Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

The swipe will start at [900, 500] and end at [300, 500]. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the \\'Tasks\\' app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Tasks\\' app, as the app drawer is the place where the app icon is expected to be found. The \\'Tasks\\' app is not visible in the current view, so scrolling is necessary.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 1: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal more apps in the list, hopefully including the \\'Tasks\\' app. The screen currently shows a portion of the app drawer. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the Tasks app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Tasks\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The swipe will start at [900, 500] and end at [300, 500]. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the \\'Tasks\\' app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Tasks\\' app, as the app drawer is the place where the app icon is expected to be found. The \\'Tasks\\' app is not visible in the current view, so scrolling is necessary.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal more apps in the list, hopefully including the \\'Tasks\\' app. The screen currently shows a portion of the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer down, revealing more apps. The \\'Tasks\\' app icon is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Tasks\\' app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 2: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[781,396],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon, which is a blue circle with a white checkmark, located at approximately [781, 396]. This action is expected to open the \\'Tasks\\' app. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the Tasks app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Tasks\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The swipe will start at [900, 500] and end at [300, 500]. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the \\'Tasks\\' app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Tasks\\' app, as the app drawer is the place where the app icon is expected to be found. The \\'Tasks\\' app is not visible in the current view, so scrolling is necessary.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal more apps in the list, hopefully including the \\'Tasks\\' app. The screen currently shows a portion of the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer down, revealing more apps. The \\'Tasks\\' app icon is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Tasks\\' app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[781,396],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon, which is a blue circle with a white checkmark, located at approximately [781, 396]. This action is expected to open the \\'Tasks\\' app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Tasks\\' app launched, and its main screen, titled \\'My Tasks\\', is now displayed, showing a list of tasks. This action successfully completed Subgoal 1 (\\'Open the Tasks app\\'). The agent is now closer to fulfilling the user\\'s request, as the necessary app is open. The next step involves identifying high-priority tasks from the displayed list.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 3 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the app drawer. The swipe will start at [900, 500] and end at [300, 500]. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the \\'Tasks\\' app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Tasks\\' app, as the app drawer is the place where the app icon is expected to be found. The \\'Tasks\\' app is not visible in the current view, so scrolling is necessary.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal more apps in the list, hopefully including the \\'Tasks\\' app. The screen currently shows a portion of the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer down, revealing more apps. The \\'Tasks\\' app icon is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Tasks\\' app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[781,396],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon, which is a blue circle with a white checkmark, located at approximately [781, 396]. This action is expected to open the \\'Tasks\\' app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Tasks\\' app launched, and its main screen, titled \\'My Tasks\\', is now displayed, showing a list of tasks. This action successfully completed Subgoal 1 (\\'Open the Tasks app\\'). The agent is now closer to fulfilling the user\\'s request, as the necessary app is open. The next step involves identifying high-priority tasks from the displayed list.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[915,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon (three horizontal lines) located at the bottom left of the screen, at approximately [915, 80]. This action is taken to explore options for filtering or viewing tasks by priority, as part of identifying all high-priority tasks. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the Tasks app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Tasks\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer and scrolled down to find the \\'Tasks\\' app. The last action tapped the \\'Tasks\\' app icon, and the \\'Tasks\\' app is now open, displaying its main screen (\\'My Tasks\\').\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Identify and extract high-priority task titles\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'HighPriorityTaskTitles\\' AgentMemoryEntry is populated with all high-priority task titles found in the app, or it\\'s confirmed that there are no high-priority tasks.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"no progress yet\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[\"Examine the \\'Tasks\\' app interface for a \\'High Priority\\' filter, tab, list, sorting option, or visual indicators (e.g., stars, colors, labels).\",\"If a specific filter, tab, or list for high-priority tasks exists, tap on it to view them.\",\"Identify all tasks that are designated as high priority.\",\"Read and record the titles of these high-priority tasks.\",\"Add the collected titles to the \\'HighPriorityTaskTitles\\' AgentMemoryEntry.\"],\"status\":\"no progress yet\"},{\"ID\":3,\"Title\":\"Format and provide the answer\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The answer containing the comma-separated list of high-priority task titles (or a message indicating none exist) has been sent to the user.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"no progress yet\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[\"Retrieve the content of the \\'HighPriorityTaskTitles\\' AgentMemoryEntry.\",\"If \\'HighPriorityTaskTitles\\' is empty, prepare the answer: \\'There are no high priority tasks.\\'\",\"If \\'HighPriorityTaskTitles\\' contains one or more titles, join them into a single string, separated by commas and a space (e.g., \\'Title 1, Title 2, Title 3\\').\",\"Send the resulting string as the answer to the user.\"],\"status\":\"no progress yet\"}],\"activeSubgoalId\":2}\\n\\n\\n\\n### Current Agent Memory ###\\n{\"memory\":[{\"VariableName\":\"HighPriorityTaskTitles\",\"Content\":\"Call client for follow-up\",\"Status\":\"A complete piece of information.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'Tasks\\' app is not visible in the current view, so scrolling is necessary.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal more apps in the list, hopefully including the \\'Tasks\\' app. The screen currently shows a portion of the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer down, revealing more apps. The \\'Tasks\\' app icon is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Tasks\\' app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[781,396],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon, which is a blue circle with a white checkmark, located at approximately [781, 396]. This action is expected to open the \\'Tasks\\' app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Tasks\\' app launched, and its main screen, titled \\'My Tasks\\', is now displayed, showing a list of tasks. This action successfully completed Subgoal 1 (\\'Open the Tasks app\\'). The agent is now closer to fulfilling the user\\'s request, as the necessary app is open. The next step involves identifying high-priority tasks from the displayed list.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[915,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon (three horizontal lines) located at the bottom left of the screen, at approximately [915, 80]. This action is taken to explore options for filtering or viewing tasks by priority, as part of identifying all high-priority tasks. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [915, 80] was successful. A side navigation menu appeared on the left side of the screen. This menu provides various options, including \\'Filters\\', which is relevant for finding high-priority tasks. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of identifying high-priority tasks.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 4 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the app drawer. The swipe will start at [900, 500] and end at [300, 500]. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the \\'Tasks\\' app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Tasks\\' app, as the app drawer is the place where the app icon is expected to be found. The \\'Tasks\\' app is not visible in the current view, so scrolling is necessary.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal more apps in the list, hopefully including the \\'Tasks\\' app. The screen currently shows a portion of the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer down, revealing more apps. The \\'Tasks\\' app icon is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Tasks\\' app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[781,396],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon, which is a blue circle with a white checkmark, located at approximately [781, 396]. This action is expected to open the \\'Tasks\\' app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Tasks\\' app launched, and its main screen, titled \\'My Tasks\\', is now displayed, showing a list of tasks. This action successfully completed Subgoal 1 (\\'Open the Tasks app\\'). The agent is now closer to fulfilling the user\\'s request, as the necessary app is open. The next step involves identifying high-priority tasks from the displayed list.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[915,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon (three horizontal lines) located at the bottom left of the screen, at approximately [915, 80]. This action is taken to explore options for filtering or viewing tasks by priority, as part of identifying all high-priority tasks. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [915, 80] was successful. A side navigation menu appeared on the left side of the screen. This menu provides various options, including \\'Filters\\', which is relevant for finding high-priority tasks. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of identifying high-priority tasks.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[403,87],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Filters\\' option in the side navigation drawer. The \\'Filters\\' text is located at approximately [403, 87]. This action is expected to open the filters view, where a \\'High Priority\\' filter might be found. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the Tasks app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Tasks\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer and scrolled down to find the \\'Tasks\\' app. The last action tapped the \\'Tasks\\' app icon, and the \\'Tasks\\' app is now open, displaying its main screen (\\'My Tasks\\').\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Identify and extract high-priority task titles\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'HighPriorityTaskTitles\\' AgentMemoryEntry is populated with all high-priority task titles found in the app, or it\\'s confirmed that there are no high-priority tasks.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Opened the Tasks app. Tapped on the hamburger menu, which opened a side navigation drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the app drawer. The swipe will start at [900, 500] and end at [300, 500]. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the \\'Tasks\\' app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Tasks\\' app, as the app drawer is the place where the app icon is expected to be found. The \\'Tasks\\' app is not visible in the current view, so scrolling is necessary.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal more apps in the list, hopefully including the \\'Tasks\\' app. The screen currently shows a portion of the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer down, revealing more apps. The \\'Tasks\\' app icon is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Tasks\\' app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[781,396],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon, which is a blue circle with a white checkmark, located at approximately [781, 396]. This action is expected to open the \\'Tasks\\' app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Tasks\\' app launched, and its main screen, titled \\'My Tasks\\', is now displayed, showing a list of tasks. This action successfully completed Subgoal 1 (\\'Open the Tasks app\\'). The agent is now closer to fulfilling the user\\'s request, as the necessary app is open. The next step involves identifying high-priority tasks from the displayed list.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[915,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon (three horizontal lines) located at the bottom left of the screen, at approximately [915, 80]. This action is taken to explore options for filtering or viewing tasks by priority, as part of identifying all high-priority tasks. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [915, 80] was successful. A side navigation menu appeared on the left side of the screen. This menu provides various options, including \\'Filters\\', which is relevant for finding high-priority tasks. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of identifying high-priority tasks.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[403,87],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Filters\\' option in the side navigation drawer. The \\'Filters\\' text is located at approximately [403, 87]. This action is expected to open the filters view, where a \\'High Priority\\' filter might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Filters\\' at [403, 87] resulted in collapsing the \\'Filters\\' section within the side navigation menu. Before the action, \\'Today\\' and \\'Recently modified\\' were visible under \\'Filters\\'. After the action, these options are hidden, and the arrow icon next to \\'Filters\\' changed from pointing upwards to downwards. This action moved the agent further from the goal of finding a high-priority filter, as it hid the potential filter options. The \\'Filters\\' section needs to be tapped again to expand it.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[501,87],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Filters\\' option in the side navigation drawer. The \\'Filters\\' text is located at approximately [501, 87]. This action is expected to expand the \\'Filters\\' section, revealing filter options such as \\'High Priority\\' or similar. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the Tasks app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Tasks\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer and scrolled down to find the \\'Tasks\\' app. The last action tapped the \\'Tasks\\' app icon, and the \\'Tasks\\' app is now open, displaying its main screen (\\'My Tasks\\').\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Identify and extract high-priority task titles\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'HighPriorityTaskTitles\\' AgentMemoryEntry is populated with all high-priority task titles found in the app, or it\\'s confirmed that there are no high-priority tasks.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Opened the Tasks app. Tapped on the hamburger menu, which opened a side navigation drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The options \\'Today\\' and \\'Recently modified\\' are now visible under \\'Filters\\'. This action corrected the previous misstep of collapsing the \\'Filters\\' section and brought the agent closer to identifying high-priority tasks by allowing inspection of available filters. However, a direct \\'High Priority\\' filter was not found within the \\'Filters\\' section. The next step is to explore the \\'Tags\\' section.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal more apps in the list, hopefully including the \\'Tasks\\' app. The screen currently shows a portion of the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer down, revealing more apps. The \\'Tasks\\' app icon is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Tasks\\' app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[781,396],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon, which is a blue circle with a white checkmark, located at approximately [781, 396]. This action is expected to open the \\'Tasks\\' app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Tasks\\' app launched, and its main screen, titled \\'My Tasks\\', is now displayed, showing a list of tasks. This action successfully completed Subgoal 1 (\\'Open the Tasks app\\'). The agent is now closer to fulfilling the user\\'s request, as the necessary app is open. The next step involves identifying high-priority tasks from the displayed list.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[915,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon (three horizontal lines) located at the bottom left of the screen, at approximately [915, 80]. This action is taken to explore options for filtering or viewing tasks by priority, as part of identifying all high-priority tasks. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [915, 80] was successful. A side navigation menu appeared on the left side of the screen. This menu provides various options, including \\'Filters\\', which is relevant for finding high-priority tasks. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of identifying high-priority tasks.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[403,87],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Filters\\' option in the side navigation drawer. The \\'Filters\\' text is located at approximately [403, 87]. This action is expected to open the filters view, where a \\'High Priority\\' filter might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Filters\\' at [403, 87] resulted in collapsing the \\'Filters\\' section within the side navigation menu. Before the action, \\'Today\\' and \\'Recently modified\\' were visible under \\'Filters\\'. After the action, these options are hidden, and the arrow icon next to \\'Filters\\' changed from pointing upwards to downwards. This action moved the agent further from the goal of finding a high-priority filter, as it hid the potential filter options. The \\'Filters\\' section needs to be tapped again to expand it.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[501,87],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Filters\\' option in the side navigation drawer. The \\'Filters\\' text is located at approximately [501, 87]. This action is expected to expand the \\'Filters\\' section, revealing filter options such as \\'High Priority\\' or similar. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Filters\\' at [501, 87] successfully expanded the \\'Filters\\' section in the side navigation menu. The options \\'Today\\' and \\'Recently modified\\' are now visible under \\'Filters\\'. This action corrected the previous misstep of collapsing the \\'Filters\\' section and brought the agent closer to identifying high-priority tasks by allowing inspection of available filters. However, a direct \\'High Priority\\' filter was not found within the \\'Filters\\' section. The next step is to explore the \\'Tags\\' section.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,76],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tags\\' option in the side navigation drawer. The \\'Tags\\' text is located at approximately [566, 76]. This action is expected to expand the \\'Tags\\' section, revealing any available tags, which might include a \\'High Priority\\' tag. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the Tasks app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Tasks\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer and scrolled down to find the \\'Tasks\\' app. The last action tapped the \\'Tasks\\' app icon, and the \\'Tasks\\' app is now open, displaying its main screen (\\'My Tasks\\').\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Identify and extract high-priority task titles\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'HighPriorityTaskTitles\\' AgentMemoryEntry is populated with all high-priority task titles found in the app, or it\\'s confirmed that there are no high-priority tasks.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Opened the Tasks app. Tapped on the hamburger menu, opening a side navigation drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The next step is to explore the \\'Tags\\' section.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,76],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tags\\' option in the side navigation drawer. The \\'Tags\\' text is located at approximately [566, 76]. This action is expected to expand the \\'Tags\\' section, revealing any available tags, which might include a \\'High Priority\\' tag. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Tags\\' at [566, 76] successfully expanded the \\'Tags\\' section in the side navigation menu. The arrow next to \\'Tags\\' changed from pointing upwards to downwards. No tags are immediately visible in the expanded section. This action was a necessary step to explore filtering by tags, but a \\'High Priority\\' tag has not yet been found. The agent is closer to determining if a tag-based filter for priority exists.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[781,396],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon, which is a blue circle with a white checkmark, located at approximately [781, 396]. This action is expected to open the \\'Tasks\\' app. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Tasks\\' app launched, and its main screen, titled \\'My Tasks\\', is now displayed, showing a list of tasks. This action successfully completed Subgoal 1 (\\'Open the Tasks app\\'). The agent is now closer to fulfilling the user\\'s request, as the necessary app is open. The next step involves identifying high-priority tasks from the displayed list.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[915,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon (three horizontal lines) located at the bottom left of the screen, at approximately [915, 80]. This action is taken to explore options for filtering or viewing tasks by priority, as part of identifying all high-priority tasks. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [915, 80] was successful. A side navigation menu appeared on the left side of the screen. This menu provides various options, including \\'Filters\\', which is relevant for finding high-priority tasks. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of identifying high-priority tasks.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[403,87],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Filters\\' option in the side navigation drawer. The \\'Filters\\' text is located at approximately [403, 87]. This action is expected to open the filters view, where a \\'High Priority\\' filter might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Filters\\' at [403, 87] resulted in collapsing the \\'Filters\\' section within the side navigation menu. Before the action, \\'Today\\' and \\'Recently modified\\' were visible under \\'Filters\\'. After the action, these options are hidden, and the arrow icon next to \\'Filters\\' changed from pointing upwards to downwards. This action moved the agent further from the goal of finding a high-priority filter, as it hid the potential filter options. The \\'Filters\\' section needs to be tapped again to expand it.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[501,87],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Filters\\' option in the side navigation drawer. The \\'Filters\\' text is located at approximately [501, 87]. This action is expected to expand the \\'Filters\\' section, revealing filter options such as \\'High Priority\\' or similar. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Filters\\' at [501, 87] successfully expanded the \\'Filters\\' section in the side navigation menu. The options \\'Today\\' and \\'Recently modified\\' are now visible under \\'Filters\\'. This action corrected the previous misstep of collapsing the \\'Filters\\' section and brought the agent closer to identifying high-priority tasks by allowing inspection of available filters. However, a direct \\'High Priority\\' filter was not found within the \\'Filters\\' section. The next step is to explore the \\'Tags\\' section.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,76],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tags\\' option in the side navigation drawer. The \\'Tags\\' text is located at approximately [566, 76]. This action is expected to expand the \\'Tags\\' section, revealing any available tags, which might include a \\'High Priority\\' tag. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Tags\\' at [566, 76] successfully expanded the \\'Tags\\' section in the side navigation menu. The arrow next to \\'Tags\\' changed from pointing upwards to downwards. No tags are immediately visible in the expanded section. This action was a necessary step to explore filtering by tags, but a \\'High Priority\\' tag has not yet been found. The agent is closer to determining if a tag-based filter for priority exists.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,250],\"end_point\":[400,250],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards within the side navigation drawer (from [700, 250] to [400, 250]) to scroll its content downwards. This is done to check if any tags, potentially including a \\'High Priority\\' tag, are listed under the \\'Tags\\' section, which is currently expanded but shows no visible tags. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the Tasks app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Tasks\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer and scrolled down to find the \\'Tasks\\' app. The last action tapped the \\'Tasks\\' app icon, and the \\'Tasks\\' app is now open, displaying its main screen (\\'My Tasks\\').\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Identify and extract high-priority task titles\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'HighPriorityTaskTitles\\' AgentMemoryEntry is populated with all high-priority task titles found in the app, or it\\'s confirmed that there are no high-priority tasks.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Opened the Tasks app. Tapped on the hamburger menu, opening a side navigation drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'Tags\\' text is located at approximately [566, 76]. This action is expected to expand the \\'Tags\\' section, revealing any available tags, which might include a \\'High Priority\\' tag. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Tags\\' at [566, 76] successfully expanded the \\'Tags\\' section in the side navigation menu. The arrow next to \\'Tags\\' changed from pointing upwards to downwards. No tags are immediately visible in the expanded section. This action was a necessary step to explore filtering by tags, but a \\'High Priority\\' tag has not yet been found. The agent is closer to determining if a tag-based filter for priority exists.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,250],\"end_point\":[400,250],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards within the side navigation drawer (from [700, 250] to [400, 250]) to scroll its content downwards. This is done to check if any tags, potentially including a \\'High Priority\\' tag, are listed under the \\'Tags\\' section, which is currently expanded but shows no visible tags. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 250] to [400, 250] was performed within the side navigation drawer. However, this action did not result in any change to the visible content of the drawer. No new tags, specifically a \\'High Priority\\' tag, were revealed. This suggests that such a tag is not available in the \\'Tags\\' section. The agent is still working towards identifying high-priority tasks, but this particular approach (finding a \\'High Priority\\' tag) did not succeed. The next step is to close the drawer and inspect the main task list.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[915,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon (three horizontal lines) located at the bottom left of the screen, at approximately [915, 80]. This action is taken to explore options for filtering or viewing tasks by priority, as part of identifying all high-priority tasks. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [915, 80] was successful. A side navigation menu appeared on the left side of the screen. This menu provides various options, including \\'Filters\\', which is relevant for finding high-priority tasks. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of identifying high-priority tasks.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[403,87],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Filters\\' option in the side navigation drawer. The \\'Filters\\' text is located at approximately [403, 87]. This action is expected to open the filters view, where a \\'High Priority\\' filter might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Filters\\' at [403, 87] resulted in collapsing the \\'Filters\\' section within the side navigation menu. Before the action, \\'Today\\' and \\'Recently modified\\' were visible under \\'Filters\\'. After the action, these options are hidden, and the arrow icon next to \\'Filters\\' changed from pointing upwards to downwards. This action moved the agent further from the goal of finding a high-priority filter, as it hid the potential filter options. The \\'Filters\\' section needs to be tapped again to expand it.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[501,87],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Filters\\' option in the side navigation drawer. The \\'Filters\\' text is located at approximately [501, 87]. This action is expected to expand the \\'Filters\\' section, revealing filter options such as \\'High Priority\\' or similar. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Filters\\' at [501, 87] successfully expanded the \\'Filters\\' section in the side navigation menu. The options \\'Today\\' and \\'Recently modified\\' are now visible under \\'Filters\\'. This action corrected the previous misstep of collapsing the \\'Filters\\' section and brought the agent closer to identifying high-priority tasks by allowing inspection of available filters. However, a direct \\'High Priority\\' filter was not found within the \\'Filters\\' section. The next step is to explore the \\'Tags\\' section.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,76],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tags\\' option in the side navigation drawer. The \\'Tags\\' text is located at approximately [566, 76]. This action is expected to expand the \\'Tags\\' section, revealing any available tags, which might include a \\'High Priority\\' tag. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Tags\\' at [566, 76] successfully expanded the \\'Tags\\' section in the side navigation menu. The arrow next to \\'Tags\\' changed from pointing upwards to downwards. No tags are immediately visible in the expanded section. This action was a necessary step to explore filtering by tags, but a \\'High Priority\\' tag has not yet been found. The agent is closer to determining if a tag-based filter for priority exists.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,250],\"end_point\":[400,250],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards within the side navigation drawer (from [700, 250] to [400, 250]) to scroll its content downwards. This is done to check if any tags, potentially including a \\'High Priority\\' tag, are listed under the \\'Tags\\' section, which is currently expanded but shows no visible tags. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 250] to [400, 250] was performed within the side navigation drawer. However, this action did not result in any change to the visible content of the drawer. No new tags, specifically a \\'High Priority\\' tag, were revealed. This suggests that such a tag is not available in the \\'Tags\\' section. The agent is still working towards identifying high-priority tasks, but this particular approach (finding a \\'High Priority\\' tag) did not succeed. The next step is to close the drawer and inspect the main task list.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[144,296],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the task \\'Read \\\\\\'The Martian\\\\\\'\\' (approximate center [144, 296]) in the main content area. This action is intended to close the side navigation drawer, allowing full view and inspection of the main task list for priority indicators. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the Tasks app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Tasks\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer and scrolled down to find the \\'Tasks\\' app. The last action tapped the \\'Tasks\\' app icon, and the \\'Tasks\\' app is now open, displaying its main screen (\\'My Tasks\\').\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Identify and extract high-priority task titles\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'HighPriorityTaskTitles\\' AgentMemoryEntry is populated with all high-priority task titles found in the app, or it\\'s confirmed that there are no high-priority tasks.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Opened the Tasks app. Tapped on the hamburger menu, opening a side navigation drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[403,87],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Filters\\' option in the side navigation drawer. The \\'Filters\\' text is located at approximately [403, 87]. This action is expected to open the filters view, where a \\'High Priority\\' filter might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Filters\\' at [403, 87] resulted in collapsing the \\'Filters\\' section within the side navigation menu. Before the action, \\'Today\\' and \\'Recently modified\\' were visible under \\'Filters\\'. After the action, these options are hidden, and the arrow icon next to \\'Filters\\' changed from pointing upwards to downwards. This action moved the agent further from the goal of finding a high-priority filter, as it hid the potential filter options. The \\'Filters\\' section needs to be tapped again to expand it.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[501,87],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Filters\\' option in the side navigation drawer. The \\'Filters\\' text is located at approximately [501, 87]. This action is expected to expand the \\'Filters\\' section, revealing filter options such as \\'High Priority\\' or similar. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Filters\\' at [501, 87] successfully expanded the \\'Filters\\' section in the side navigation menu. The options \\'Today\\' and \\'Recently modified\\' are now visible under \\'Filters\\'. This action corrected the previous misstep of collapsing the \\'Filters\\' section and brought the agent closer to identifying high-priority tasks by allowing inspection of available filters. However, a direct \\'High Priority\\' filter was not found within the \\'Filters\\' section. The next step is to explore the \\'Tags\\' section.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,76],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tags\\' option in the side navigation drawer. The \\'Tags\\' text is located at approximately [566, 76]. This action is expected to expand the \\'Tags\\' section, revealing any available tags, which might include a \\'High Priority\\' tag. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Tags\\' at [566, 76] successfully expanded the \\'Tags\\' section in the side navigation menu. The arrow next to \\'Tags\\' changed from pointing upwards to downwards. No tags are immediately visible in the expanded section. This action was a necessary step to explore filtering by tags, but a \\'High Priority\\' tag has not yet been found. The agent is closer to determining if a tag-based filter for priority exists.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,250],\"end_point\":[400,250],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards within the side navigation drawer (from [700, 250] to [400, 250]) to scroll its content downwards. This is done to check if any tags, potentially including a \\'High Priority\\' tag, are listed under the \\'Tags\\' section, which is currently expanded but shows no visible tags. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 250] to [400, 250] was performed within the side navigation drawer. However, this action did not result in any change to the visible content of the drawer. No new tags, specifically a \\'High Priority\\' tag, were revealed. This suggests that such a tag is not available in the \\'Tags\\' section. The agent is still working towards identifying high-priority tasks, but this particular approach (finding a \\'High Priority\\' tag) did not succeed. The next step is to close the drawer and inspect the main task list.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[144,296],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the task \\'Read \\\\\\'The Martian\\\\\\'\\' (approximate center [144, 296]) in the main content area. This action is intended to close the side navigation drawer, allowing full view and inspection of the main task list for priority indicators. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the task \\'Read \\\\\\'The Martian\\\\\\'\\' at approximately [144, 296] successfully closed the side navigation drawer. The main \\'My Tasks\\' screen is now fully displayed, showing the list of tasks. This action achieved its goal of closing the drawer, allowing for an unobstructed view of the tasks, and brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal of identifying high-priority tasks by enabling further inspection.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[403,87],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Filters\\' option in the side navigation drawer. The \\'Filters\\' text is located at approximately [403, 87]. This action is expected to open the filters view, where a \\'High Priority\\' filter might be found. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Filters\\' at [403, 87] resulted in collapsing the \\'Filters\\' section within the side navigation menu. Before the action, \\'Today\\' and \\'Recently modified\\' were visible under \\'Filters\\'. After the action, these options are hidden, and the arrow icon next to \\'Filters\\' changed from pointing upwards to downwards. This action moved the agent further from the goal of finding a high-priority filter, as it hid the potential filter options. The \\'Filters\\' section needs to be tapped again to expand it.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[501,87],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Filters\\' option in the side navigation drawer. The \\'Filters\\' text is located at approximately [501, 87]. This action is expected to expand the \\'Filters\\' section, revealing filter options such as \\'High Priority\\' or similar. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Filters\\' at [501, 87] successfully expanded the \\'Filters\\' section in the side navigation menu. The options \\'Today\\' and \\'Recently modified\\' are now visible under \\'Filters\\'. This action corrected the previous misstep of collapsing the \\'Filters\\' section and brought the agent closer to identifying high-priority tasks by allowing inspection of available filters. However, a direct \\'High Priority\\' filter was not found within the \\'Filters\\' section. The next step is to explore the \\'Tags\\' section.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,76],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tags\\' option in the side navigation drawer. The \\'Tags\\' text is located at approximately [566, 76]. This action is expected to expand the \\'Tags\\' section, revealing any available tags, which might include a \\'High Priority\\' tag. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Tags\\' at [566, 76] successfully expanded the \\'Tags\\' section in the side navigation menu. The arrow next to \\'Tags\\' changed from pointing upwards to downwards. No tags are immediately visible in the expanded section. This action was a necessary step to explore filtering by tags, but a \\'High Priority\\' tag has not yet been found. The agent is closer to determining if a tag-based filter for priority exists.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,250],\"end_point\":[400,250],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards within the side navigation drawer (from [700, 250] to [400, 250]) to scroll its content downwards. This is done to check if any tags, potentially including a \\'High Priority\\' tag, are listed under the \\'Tags\\' section, which is currently expanded but shows no visible tags. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 250] to [400, 250] was performed within the side navigation drawer. However, this action did not result in any change to the visible content of the drawer. No new tags, specifically a \\'High Priority\\' tag, were revealed. This suggests that such a tag is not available in the \\'Tags\\' section. The agent is still working towards identifying high-priority tasks, but this particular approach (finding a \\'High Priority\\' tag) did not succeed. The next step is to close the drawer and inspect the main task list.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[144,296],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the task \\'Read \\\\\\'The Martian\\\\\\'\\' (approximate center [144, 296]) in the main content area. This action is intended to close the side navigation drawer, allowing full view and inspection of the main task list for priority indicators. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the task \\'Read \\\\\\'The Martian\\\\\\'\\' at approximately [144, 296] successfully closed the side navigation drawer. The main \\'My Tasks\\' screen is now fully displayed, showing the list of tasks. This action achieved its goal of closing the drawer, allowing for an unobstructed view of the tasks, and brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal of identifying high-priority tasks by enabling further inspection.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[384,334],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the task \\'Call client for follow-up\\'. The text for this task is located at approximately [384, 334]. This action is expected to open the detail view for this task, where I can look for priority indicators. The checkbox for this task is red, which might signify high priority. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the Tasks app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Tasks\\' app is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer and scrolled down to find the \\'Tasks\\' app. The last action tapped the \\'Tasks\\' app icon, and the \\'Tasks\\' app is now open, displaying its main screen (\\'My Tasks\\').\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Identify and extract high-priority task titles\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'HighPriorityTaskTitles\\' AgentMemoryEntry is populated with all high-priority task titles found in the app, or it\\'s confirmed that there are no high-priority tasks.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Opened the Tasks app. Tapped on the hamburger menu, opening a side navigation drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[501,87],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Filters\\' option in the side navigation drawer. The \\'Filters\\' text is located at approximately [501, 87]. This action is expected to expand the \\'Filters\\' section, revealing filter options such as \\'High Priority\\' or similar. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Filters\\' at [501, 87] successfully expanded the \\'Filters\\' section in the side navigation menu. The options \\'Today\\' and \\'Recently modified\\' are now visible under \\'Filters\\'. This action corrected the previous misstep of collapsing the \\'Filters\\' section and brought the agent closer to identifying high-priority tasks by allowing inspection of available filters. However, a direct \\'High Priority\\' filter was not found within the \\'Filters\\' section. The next step is to explore the \\'Tags\\' section.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,76],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tags\\' option in the side navigation drawer. The \\'Tags\\' text is located at approximately [566, 76]. This action is expected to expand the \\'Tags\\' section, revealing any available tags, which might include a \\'High Priority\\' tag. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Tags\\' at [566, 76] successfully expanded the \\'Tags\\' section in the side navigation menu. The arrow next to \\'Tags\\' changed from pointing upwards to downwards. No tags are immediately visible in the expanded section. This action was a necessary step to explore filtering by tags, but a \\'High Priority\\' tag has not yet been found. The agent is closer to determining if a tag-based filter for priority exists.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,250],\"end_point\":[400,250],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe upwards within the side navigation drawer (from [700, 250] to [400, 250]) to scroll its content downwards. This is done to check if any tags, potentially including a \\'High Priority\\' tag, are listed under the \\'Tags\\' section, which is currently expanded but shows no visible tags. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [700, 250] to [400, 250] was performed within the side navigation drawer. However, this action did not result in any change to the visible content of the drawer. No new tags, specifically a \\'High Priority\\' tag, were revealed. This suggests that such a tag is not available in the \\'Tags\\' section. The agent is still working towards identifying high-priority tasks, but this particular approach (finding a \\'High Priority\\' tag) did not succeed. The next step is to close the drawer and inspect the main task list.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[144,296],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the task \\'Read \\\\\\'The Martian\\\\\\'\\' (approximate center [144, 296]) in the main content area. This action is intended to close the side navigation drawer, allowing full view and inspection of the main task list for priority indicators. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the task \\'Read \\\\\\'The Martian\\\\\\'\\' at approximately [144, 296] successfully closed the side navigation drawer. The main \\'My Tasks\\' screen is now fully displayed, showing the list of tasks. This action achieved its goal of closing the drawer, allowing for an unobstructed view of the tasks, and brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal of identifying high-priority tasks by enabling further inspection.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[384,334],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the task \\'Call client for follow-up\\'. The text for this task is located at approximately [384, 334]. This action is expected to open the detail view for this task, where I can look for priority indicators. The checkbox for this task is red, which might signify high priority. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Call client for follow-up\\' successfully opened its detail view. This view confirmed that the task is high priority, as indicated by the selected red priority circle. This action was successful in identifying a high-priority task and its title. Based on the visual inspection of the main task list in the previous step (screenshot 1), this is the only task with a high-priority indicator (red checkbox). Thus, all high-priority tasks have been identified, and the relevant information has been gathered.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
