Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current screen is the home screen. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. This is a positive step towards completing the active subgoal, which is to open the Tasks app. The app drawer is now visible, and the next step is to find the Tasks app within it.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (start_point: [900, 500]) to the upper-middle of the screen (end_point: [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer and reveal more apps. The current screen shows a list of apps, but the \\'Tasks\\' app is not visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more apps. The \\'Tasks\\' app, identified by its name and a checkmark icon, is now visible in the screenshot. The bounding box for the text \\'Tasks\\' is [811, 342, 826, 437]. The icon is located above this text. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Tasks app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 2: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below.

If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 3 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (start_point: [900, 500]) to the upper-middle of the screen (end_point: [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. This is a positive step towards completing the active subgoal, which is to open the Tasks app. The app drawer is now visible, and the next step is to find the Tasks app within it.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (start_point: [900, 500]) to the upper-middle of the screen (end_point: [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer and reveal more apps. The current screen shows a list of apps, but the \\'Tasks\\' app is not visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more apps. The \\'Tasks\\' app, identified by its name and a checkmark icon, is now visible in the screenshot. The bounding box for the text \\'Tasks\\' is [811, 342, 826, 437]. The icon is located above this text. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Tasks app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[818,389],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tasks\\' app text, which is located at approximately [818, 389]. This action is intended to open the Tasks app. The \\'Tasks\\' app is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon was successful. The Tasks app opened, and the \\'My Tasks\\' screen is now visible. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully completing the first subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[940,70],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (estimated coordinates [940, 70]). This icon typically opens a navigation drawer or menu which might contain options to select a specific date or view a calendar. The hamburger menu icon is currently visible and not interacted with. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Tasks App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Tasks app is open and its main screen is visible, OR it\\'s determined that the Tasks app is not installed and `completedTaskTitles` in AgentMemory is updated to \\'Tasks app not found.\\'\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened, and the \\'Tasks\\' app was located.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.

The current screen is the home screen. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. This is a positive step towards completing the active subgoal, which is to open the Tasks app. The app drawer is now visible, and the next step is to find the Tasks app within it.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (start_point: [900, 500]) to the upper-middle of the screen (end_point: [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer and reveal more apps. The current screen shows a list of apps, but the \\'Tasks\\' app is not visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more apps. The \\'Tasks\\' app, identified by its name and a checkmark icon, is now visible in the screenshot. The bounding box for the text \\'Tasks\\' is [811, 342, 826, 437]. The icon is located above this text. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Tasks app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[818,389],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tasks\\' app text, which is located at approximately [818, 389]. This action is intended to open the Tasks app. The \\'Tasks\\' app is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon was successful. The Tasks app opened, and the \\'My Tasks\\' screen is now visible. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully completing the first subgoal.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[940,70],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (estimated coordinates [940, 70]). This icon typically opens a navigation drawer or menu which might contain options to select a specific date or view a calendar. The hamburger menu icon is currently visible and not interacted with. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [940, 70] failed. The screen did not change, and no menu or pop-up appeared. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, I will try interacting with a different UI element.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

Answer with the titles only. If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 4 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (start_point: [900, 500]) to the upper-middle of the screen (end_point: [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. This is a positive step towards completing the active subgoal, which is to open the Tasks app. The app drawer is now visible, and the next step is to find the Tasks app within it.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (start_point: [900, 500]) to the upper-middle of the screen (end_point: [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer and reveal more apps. The current screen shows a list of apps, but the \\'Tasks\\' app is not visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more apps. The \\'Tasks\\' app, identified by its name and a checkmark icon, is now visible in the screenshot. The bounding box for the text \\'Tasks\\' is [811, 342, 826, 437]. The icon is located above this text. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Tasks app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[818,389],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tasks\\' app text, which is located at approximately [818, 389]. This action is intended to open the Tasks app. The \\'Tasks\\' app is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon was successful. The Tasks app opened, and the \\'My Tasks\\' screen is now visible. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully completing the first subgoal.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[940,70],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (estimated coordinates [940, 70]). This icon typically opens a navigation drawer or menu which might contain options to select a specific date or view a calendar. The hamburger menu icon is currently visible and not interacted with. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [940, 70] failed. The screen did not change, and no menu or pop-up appeared. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, I will try interacting with a different UI element.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,941],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [85, 941]. This is to explore options for navigating to a specific date. The search icon is currently visible and has not been interacted with in this context. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Tasks App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Tasks app is open and its main screen is visible, OR it\\'s determined that the Tasks app is not installed and `completedTaskTitles` in AgentMemory is updated to \\'Tasks app not found.\\'\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened, and the \\'Tasks\\' app was located.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current screen is the home screen. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. This is a positive step towards completing the active subgoal, which is to open the Tasks app. The app drawer is now visible, and the next step is to find the Tasks app within it.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (start_point: [900, 500]) to the upper-middle of the screen (end_point: [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer and reveal more apps. The current screen shows a list of apps, but the \\'Tasks\\' app is not visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more apps. The \\'Tasks\\' app, identified by its name and a checkmark icon, is now visible in the screenshot. The bounding box for the text \\'Tasks\\' is [811, 342, 826, 437]. The icon is located above this text. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Tasks app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[818,389],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tasks\\' app text, which is located at approximately [818, 389]. This action is intended to open the Tasks app. The \\'Tasks\\' app is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon was successful. The Tasks app opened, and the \\'My Tasks\\' screen is now visible. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully completing the first subgoal.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[940,70],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (estimated coordinates [940, 70]). This icon typically opens a navigation drawer or menu which might contain options to select a specific date or view a calendar. The hamburger menu icon is currently visible and not interacted with. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [940, 70] failed. The screen did not change, and no menu or pop-up appeared. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, I will try interacting with a different UI element.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,941],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [85, 941]. This is to explore options for navigating to a specific date. The search icon is currently visible and has not been interacted with in this context. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon at [85, 941] was successful in that it opened a search interface. A search bar appeared at the top of the screen, replacing the \"My Tasks\" title, and the virtual keyboard became visible. While the action itself was executed correctly, the resulting search interface is not the desired date navigation feature. Therefore, this action did not directly bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date. The next step should be to close this search interface.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"   \" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (start_point: [900, 500]) to the upper-middle of the screen (end_point: [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. This is a positive step towards completing the active subgoal, which is to open the Tasks app. The app drawer is now visible, and the next step is to find the Tasks app within it.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (start_point: [900, 500]) to the upper-middle of the screen (end_point: [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer and reveal more apps. The current screen shows a list of apps, but the \\'Tasks\\' app is not visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more apps. The \\'Tasks\\' app, identified by its name and a checkmark icon, is now visible in the screenshot. The bounding box for the text \\'Tasks\\' is [811, 342, 826, 437]. The icon is located above this text. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Tasks app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[818,389],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tasks\\' app text, which is located at approximately [818, 389]. This action is intended to open the Tasks app. The \\'Tasks\\' app is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon was successful. The Tasks app opened, and the \\'My Tasks\\' screen is now visible. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully completing the first subgoal.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[940,70],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (estimated coordinates [940, 70]). This icon typically opens a navigation drawer or menu which might contain options to select a specific date or view a calendar. The hamburger menu icon is currently visible and not interacted with. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [940, 70] failed. The screen did not change, and no menu or pop-up appeared. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, I will try interacting with a different UI element.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,941],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [85, 941]. This is to explore options for navigating to a specific date. The search icon is currently visible and has not been interacted with in this context. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon at [85, 941] was successful in that it opened a search interface. A search bar appeared at the top of the screen, replacing the \"My Tasks\" title, and the virtual keyboard became visible. While the action itself was executed correctly, the resulting search interface is not the desired date navigation feature. Therefore, this action did not directly bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date. The next step should be to close this search interface.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current screen shows a list of apps, but the \\'Tasks\\' app is not visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more apps. The \\'Tasks\\' app, identified by its name and a checkmark icon, is now visible in the screenshot. The bounding box for the text \\'Tasks\\' is [811, 342, 826, 437]. The icon is located above this text. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Tasks app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[818,389],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tasks\\' app text, which is located at approximately [818, 389]. This action is intended to open the Tasks app. The \\'Tasks\\' app is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon was successful. The Tasks app opened, and the \\'My Tasks\\' screen is now visible. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully completing the first subgoal.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[940,70],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (estimated coordinates [940, 70]). This icon typically opens a navigation drawer or menu which might contain options to select a specific date or view a calendar. The hamburger menu icon is currently visible and not interacted with. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [940, 70] failed. The screen did not change, and no menu or pop-up appeared. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, I will try interacting with a different UI element.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,941],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [85, 941]. This is to explore options for navigating to a specific date. The search icon is currently visible and has not been interacted with in this context. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon at [85, 941] was successful in that it opened a search interface. A search bar appeared at the top of the screen, replacing the \"My Tasks\" title, and the virtual keyboard became visible. While the action itself was executed correctly, the resulting search interface is not the desired date navigation feature. Therefore, this action did not directly bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date. The next step should be to close this search interface.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The back arrow icon is currently visible at the top left of the screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon at [85, 85] was successful. The search interface, which included a search bar and the virtual keyboard, was closed. The screen returned to the previous state, displaying the \"My Tasks\" title at the top left and the list of tasks. This action corrected the previous misstep of opening the text search and brought the agent closer to finding a way to navigate to a specific date within the Tasks app.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (start_point: [900, 500]) to the upper-middle of the screen (end_point: [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer and reveal more apps. The current screen shows a list of apps, but the \\'Tasks\\' app is not visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more apps. The \\'Tasks\\' app, identified by its name and a checkmark icon, is now visible in the screenshot. The bounding box for the text \\'Tasks\\' is [811, 342, 826, 437]. The icon is located above this text. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Tasks app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[818,389],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tasks\\' app text, which is located at approximately [818, 389]. This action is intended to open the Tasks app. The \\'Tasks\\' app is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon was successful. The Tasks app opened, and the \\'My Tasks\\' screen is now visible. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully completing the first subgoal.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[940,70],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (estimated coordinates [940, 70]). This icon typically opens a navigation drawer or menu which might contain options to select a specific date or view a calendar. The hamburger menu icon is currently visible and not interacted with. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [940, 70] failed. The screen did not change, and no menu or pop-up appeared. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, I will try interacting with a different UI element.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,941],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [85, 941]. This is to explore options for navigating to a specific date. The search icon is currently visible and has not been interacted with in this context. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon at [85, 941] was successful in that it opened a search interface. A search bar appeared at the top of the screen, replacing the \"My Tasks\" title, and the virtual keyboard became visible. While the action itself was executed correctly, the resulting search interface is not the desired date navigation feature. Therefore, this action did not directly bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date. The next step should be to close this search interface.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,85],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, estimated to be at [85, 85], to close the search interface and return to the previous screen. The back arrow icon is currently visible at the top left of the screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon at [85, 85] was successful. The search interface, which included a search bar and the virtual keyboard, was closed. The screen returned to the previous state, displaying the \"My Tasks\" title at the top left and the list of tasks. This action corrected the previous misstep of opening the text search and brought the agent closer to finding a way to navigate to a specific date within the Tasks app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[86,149],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"My Tasks\" text, located at the top left of the screen (center at approximately [86, 149]). This is to check if tapping this element reveals any date navigation options or a way to switch views. The \"My Tasks\" text is currently visible.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[818,389],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tasks\\' app text, which is located at approximately [818, 389]. This action is intended to open the Tasks app. The \\'Tasks\\' app is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon was successful. The Tasks app opened, and the \\'My Tasks\\' screen is now visible. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully completing the first subgoal.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[940,70],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (estimated coordinates [940, 70]). This icon typically opens a navigation drawer or menu which might contain options to select a specific date or view a calendar. The hamburger menu icon is currently visible and not interacted with. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [940, 70] failed. The screen did not change, and no menu or pop-up appeared. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, I will try interacting with a different UI element.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,941],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [85, 941]. This is to explore options for navigating to a specific date. The search icon is currently visible and has not been interacted with in this context. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon at [85, 941] was successful in that it opened a search interface. A search bar appeared at the top of the screen, replacing the \"My Tasks\" title, and the virtual keyboard became visible. While the action itself was executed correctly, the resulting search interface is not the desired date navigation feature. Therefore, this action did not directly bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date. The next step should be to close this search interface.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,85],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, estimated to be at [85, 85], to close the search interface and return to the previous screen. The back arrow icon is currently visible at the top left of the screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon at [85, 85] was successful. The search interface, which included a search bar and the virtual keyboard, was closed. The screen returned to the previous state, displaying the \"My Tasks\" title at the top left and the list of tasks. This action corrected the previous misstep of opening the text search and brought the agent closer to finding a way to navigate to a specific date within the Tasks app.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[86,149],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"My Tasks\" text, located at the top left of the screen (center at approximately [86, 149]). This is to check if tapping this element reveals any date navigation options or a way to switch views. The \"My Tasks\" text is currently visible. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'My Tasks\\' at [86, 149] failed. The screen remained unchanged, and no date navigation options or menus appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen, at approximately [945, 72]. This icon is part of the blue navigation bar at the bottom. This action is taken to open a menu or navigation drawer, which might provide options to navigate to a specific date (October 16, 2023). The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Tasks App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Tasks app is open and its main screen is visible, OR it\\'s determined that the Tasks app is not installed and `completedTaskTitles` in AgentMemory is updated to \\'Tasks app not found.\\'\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened, and the \\'Tasks\\' app was located.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[940,70],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (estimated coordinates [940, 70]). This icon typically opens a navigation drawer or menu which might contain options to select a specific date or view a calendar. The hamburger menu icon is currently visible and not interacted with. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [940, 70] failed. The screen did not change, and no menu or pop-up appeared. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, I will try interacting with a different UI element.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,941],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [85, 941]. This is to explore options for navigating to a specific date. The search icon is currently visible and has not been interacted with in this context. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon at [85, 941] was successful in that it opened a search interface. A search bar appeared at the top of the screen, replacing the \"My Tasks\" title, and the virtual keyboard became visible. While the action itself was executed correctly, the resulting search interface is not the desired date navigation feature. Therefore, this action did not directly bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date. The next step should be to close this search interface.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,85],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, estimated to be at [85, 85], to close the search interface and return to the previous screen. The back arrow icon is currently visible at the top left of the screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon at [85, 85] was successful. The search interface, which included a search bar and the virtual keyboard, was closed. The screen returned to the previous state, displaying the \"My Tasks\" title at the top left and the list of tasks. This action corrected the previous misstep of opening the text search and brought the agent closer to finding a way to navigate to a specific date within the Tasks app.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[86,149],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"My Tasks\" text, located at the top left of the screen (center at approximately [86, 149]). This is to check if tapping this element reveals any date navigation options or a way to switch views. The \"My Tasks\" text is currently visible. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'My Tasks\\' at [86, 149] failed. The screen remained unchanged, and no date navigation options or menus appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen, at approximately [945, 72]. This icon is part of the blue navigation bar at the bottom. This action is taken to open a menu or navigation drawer, which might provide options to navigate to a specific date (October 16, 2023). Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [945, 72] was successful. A side menu appeared on the left side of the screen, containing various navigation and filter options. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date by revealing a menu with a \\'Today\\' option, which could potentially lead to a date picker.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'[Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'[Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 38, 100, 260], \\'text\\': \\'My Tasks\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [135, 134, 157, 414], \\'text\\': \\'Organize Closet\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [138, 903, 153, 965], \\'text\\': \\'Thu\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [198, 134, 221, 512], \\'text\\': \\'Attend Team Meeting\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [201, 894, 217, 963], \\'text\\': \\'Wed\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [262, 134, 280, 359], \\'text\\': \\'Water Plants\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [265, 905, 280, 965], \\'text\\': \\'Tue\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [290, 133, 308, 932], \\'text\\': \\'Check moisture level before waterina_Fertilize_\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [338, 173, 358, 325], \\'text\\': \\'My Tasks\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [340, 922, 354, 965], \\'text\\': \\'10\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [396, 37, 411, 137], \\'text\\': \\'Filters\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [447, 168, 468, 274], \\'text\\': \\'Today\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [501, 170, 521, 455], \\'text\\': \\'Recently modified\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [503, 922, 517, 965], \\'text\\': \\'13\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [557, 31, 578, 121], \\'text\\': \\'Tags\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [616, 38, 632, 145], \\'text\\': \\'Places\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [673, 38, 689, 197], \\'text\\': \\'Local lists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [727, 172, 743, 345], \\'text\\': \\'Default list\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [782, 172, 797, 287], \\'text\\': \\'Donate\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 171, 854, 417], \\'text\\': \\'Manage drawer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [887, 169, 906, 307], \\'text\\': \\'Settings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [939, 169, 959, 433], \\'text\\': \\'Help & feedback\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 901, 103, 983]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [924, 1, 977, 637]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [870, 4, 924, 999]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [431, 35, 484, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [483, 7, 541, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [818, 5, 872, 999]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 249, 36, 295]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [765, 5, 820, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 197, 35, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [384, 894, 423, 975]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [382, 791, 426, 878]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [307, 112, 378, 1000]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[940,70],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (estimated coordinates [940, 70]). This icon typically opens a navigation drawer or menu which might contain options to select a specific date or view a calendar. The hamburger menu icon is currently visible and not interacted with. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [940, 70] failed. The screen did not change, and no menu or pop-up appeared. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, I will try interacting with a different UI element.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,941],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [85, 941]. This is to explore options for navigating to a specific date. The search icon is currently visible and has not been interacted with in this context. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon at [85, 941] was successful in that it opened a search interface. A search bar appeared at the top of the screen, replacing the \"My Tasks\" title, and the virtual keyboard became visible. While the action itself was executed correctly, the resulting search interface is not the desired date navigation feature. Therefore, this action did not directly bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date. The next step should be to close this search interface.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,85],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, estimated to be at [85, 85], to close the search interface and return to the previous screen. The back arrow icon is currently visible at the top left of the screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon at [85, 85] was successful. The search interface, which included a search bar and the virtual keyboard, was closed. The screen returned to the previous state, displaying the \"My Tasks\" title at the top left and the list of tasks. This action corrected the previous misstep of opening the text search and brought the agent closer to finding a way to navigate to a specific date within the Tasks app.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[86,149],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"My Tasks\" text, located at the top left of the screen (center at approximately [86, 149]). This is to check if tapping this element reveals any date navigation options or a way to switch views. The \"My Tasks\" text is currently visible. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'My Tasks\\' at [86, 149] failed. The screen remained unchanged, and no date navigation options or menus appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen, at approximately [945, 72]. This icon is part of the blue navigation bar at the bottom. This action is taken to open a menu or navigation drawer, which might provide options to navigate to a specific date (October 16, 2023). Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [945, 72] was successful. A side menu appeared on the left side of the screen, containing various navigation and filter options. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date by revealing a menu with a \\'Today\\' option, which could potentially lead to a date picker.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,221],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu, located at approximately [457, 221]. This action is intended to open a calendar or date selection interface, allowing navigation to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' option is currently visible in the opened side menu. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Tasks App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Tasks app is open and its main screen is visible, OR it\\'s determined that the Tasks app is not installed and `completedTaskTitles` in AgentMemory is updated to \\'Tasks app not found.\\'\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened, and the \\'Tasks\\' app was located.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,941],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [85, 941]. This is to explore options for navigating to a specific date. The search icon is currently visible and has not been interacted with in this context. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon at [85, 941] was successful in that it opened a search interface. A search bar appeared at the top of the screen, replacing the \"My Tasks\" title, and the virtual keyboard became visible. While the action itself was executed correctly, the resulting search interface is not the desired date navigation feature. Therefore, this action did not directly bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date. The next step should be to close this search interface.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,85],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, estimated to be at [85, 85], to close the search interface and return to the previous screen. The back arrow icon is currently visible at the top left of the screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon at [85, 85] was successful. The search interface, which included a search bar and the virtual keyboard, was closed. The screen returned to the previous state, displaying the \"My Tasks\" title at the top left and the list of tasks. This action corrected the previous misstep of opening the text search and brought the agent closer to finding a way to navigate to a specific date within the Tasks app.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[86,149],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"My Tasks\" text, located at the top left of the screen (center at approximately [86, 149]). This is to check if tapping this element reveals any date navigation options or a way to switch views. The \"My Tasks\" text is currently visible. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'My Tasks\\' at [86, 149] failed. The screen remained unchanged, and no date navigation options or menus appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen, at approximately [945, 72]. This icon is part of the blue navigation bar at the bottom. This action is taken to open a menu or navigation drawer, which might provide options to navigate to a specific date (October 16, 2023). Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [945, 72] was successful. A side menu appeared on the left side of the screen, containing various navigation and filter options. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date by revealing a menu with a \\'Today\\' option, which could potentially lead to a date picker.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,221],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu, located at approximately [457, 221]. This action is intended to open a calendar or date selection interface, allowing navigation to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' option is currently visible in the opened side menu. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu (located at approximately [457, 221]) was successful. The side menu closed, and the app navigated to a view displaying tasks for \\'Today\\'. The title of the screen changed from \\'My Tasks\\' (when the side menu was open over it) to \\'Today\\'. This action brought the agent closer to the goal by changing the view, but it did not directly allow for selecting a specific date. The current view is for \\'Today\\', not October 16, 2023.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,941],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top right of the screen, at approximately [85, 941]. This is to explore options for navigating to a specific date. The search icon is currently visible and has not been interacted with in this context. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon at [85, 941] was successful in that it opened a search interface. A search bar appeared at the top of the screen, replacing the \"My Tasks\" title, and the virtual keyboard became visible. While the action itself was executed correctly, the resulting search interface is not the desired date navigation feature. Therefore, this action did not directly bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date. The next step should be to close this search interface.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,85],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, estimated to be at [85, 85], to close the search interface and return to the previous screen. The back arrow icon is currently visible at the top left of the screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon at [85, 85] was successful. The search interface, which included a search bar and the virtual keyboard, was closed. The screen returned to the previous state, displaying the \"My Tasks\" title at the top left and the list of tasks. This action corrected the previous misstep of opening the text search and brought the agent closer to finding a way to navigate to a specific date within the Tasks app.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[86,149],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"My Tasks\" text, located at the top left of the screen (center at approximately [86, 149]). This is to check if tapping this element reveals any date navigation options or a way to switch views. The \"My Tasks\" text is currently visible. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'My Tasks\\' at [86, 149] failed. The screen remained unchanged, and no date navigation options or menus appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen, at approximately [945, 72]. This icon is part of the blue navigation bar at the bottom. This action is taken to open a menu or navigation drawer, which might provide options to navigate to a specific date (October 16, 2023). Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [945, 72] was successful. A side menu appeared on the left side of the screen, containing various navigation and filter options. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date by revealing a menu with a \\'Today\\' option, which could potentially lead to a date picker.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,221],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu, located at approximately [457, 221]. This action is intended to open a calendar or date selection interface, allowing navigation to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' option is currently visible in the opened side menu. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu (located at approximately [457, 221]) was successful. The side menu closed, and the app navigated to a view displaying tasks for \\'Today\\'. The title of the screen changed from \\'My Tasks\\' (when the side menu was open over it) to \\'Today\\'. This action brought the agent closer to the goal by changing the view, but it did not directly allow for selecting a specific date. The current view is for \\'Today\\', not October 16, 2023.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[86,107],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' title, located at the top of the screen (center at approximately [86, 107]). This is to check if tapping this element opens a date picker or calendar interface, which would allow navigation to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' title is currently visible. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Tasks App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Tasks app is open and its main screen is visible, OR it\\'s determined that the Tasks app is not installed and `completedTaskTitles` in AgentMemory is updated to \\'Tasks app not found.\\'\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened, and the \\'Tasks\\' app was located.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The back arrow icon is currently visible at the top left of the screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon at [85, 85] was successful. The search interface, which included a search bar and the virtual keyboard, was closed. The screen returned to the previous state, displaying the \"My Tasks\" title at the top left and the list of tasks. This action corrected the previous misstep of opening the text search and brought the agent closer to finding a way to navigate to a specific date within the Tasks app.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[86,149],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"My Tasks\" text, located at the top left of the screen (center at approximately [86, 149]). This is to check if tapping this element reveals any date navigation options or a way to switch views. The \"My Tasks\" text is currently visible. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'My Tasks\\' at [86, 149] failed. The screen remained unchanged, and no date navigation options or menus appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen, at approximately [945, 72]. This icon is part of the blue navigation bar at the bottom. This action is taken to open a menu or navigation drawer, which might provide options to navigate to a specific date (October 16, 2023). Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [945, 72] was successful. A side menu appeared on the left side of the screen, containing various navigation and filter options. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date by revealing a menu with a \\'Today\\' option, which could potentially lead to a date picker.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,221],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu, located at approximately [457, 221]. This action is intended to open a calendar or date selection interface, allowing navigation to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' option is currently visible in the opened side menu. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu (located at approximately [457, 221]) was successful. The side menu closed, and the app navigated to a view displaying tasks for \\'Today\\'. The title of the screen changed from \\'My Tasks\\' (when the side menu was open over it) to \\'Today\\'. This action brought the agent closer to the goal by changing the view, but it did not directly allow for selecting a specific date. The current view is for \\'Today\\', not October 16, 2023.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[86,107],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' title, located at the top of the screen (center at approximately [86, 107]). This is to check if tapping this element opens a date picker or calendar interface, which would allow navigation to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' title is currently visible. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Today\\' title at [86, 107] was unsuccessful. The screen remained unchanged, and no date picker or calendar interface appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 16, 2023. The next step will be to explore other UI elements for date navigation options.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,85],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, estimated to be at [85, 85], to close the search interface and return to the previous screen. The back arrow icon is currently visible at the top left of the screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon at [85, 85] was successful. The search interface, which included a search bar and the virtual keyboard, was closed. The screen returned to the previous state, displaying the \"My Tasks\" title at the top left and the list of tasks. This action corrected the previous misstep of opening the text search and brought the agent closer to finding a way to navigate to a specific date within the Tasks app.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[86,149],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"My Tasks\" text, located at the top left of the screen (center at approximately [86, 149]). This is to check if tapping this element reveals any date navigation options or a way to switch views. The \"My Tasks\" text is currently visible. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'My Tasks\\' at [86, 149] failed. The screen remained unchanged, and no date navigation options or menus appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen, at approximately [945, 72]. This icon is part of the blue navigation bar at the bottom. This action is taken to open a menu or navigation drawer, which might provide options to navigate to a specific date (October 16, 2023). Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [945, 72] was successful. A side menu appeared on the left side of the screen, containing various navigation and filter options. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date by revealing a menu with a \\'Today\\' option, which could potentially lead to a date picker.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,221],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu, located at approximately [457, 221]. This action is intended to open a calendar or date selection interface, allowing navigation to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' option is currently visible in the opened side menu. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu (located at approximately [457, 221]) was successful. The side menu closed, and the app navigated to a view displaying tasks for \\'Today\\'. The title of the screen changed from \\'My Tasks\\' (when the side menu was open over it) to \\'Today\\'. This action brought the agent closer to the goal by changing the view, but it did not directly allow for selecting a specific date. The current view is for \\'Today\\', not October 16, 2023.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[86,107],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' title, located at the top of the screen (center at approximately [86, 107]). This is to check if tapping this element opens a date picker or calendar interface, which would allow navigation to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' title is currently visible. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Today\\' title at [86, 107] was unsuccessful. The screen remained unchanged, and no date picker or calendar interface appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 16, 2023. The next step will be to explore other UI elements for date navigation options.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'My Tasks\\' at [86, 149] failed. The screen remained unchanged, and no date navigation options or menus appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This icon is part of the blue navigation bar at the bottom. This action is taken to open a menu or navigation drawer, which might provide options to navigate to a specific date (October 16, 2023). Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [945, 72] was successful. A side menu appeared on the left side of the screen, containing various navigation and filter options. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date by revealing a menu with a \\'Today\\' option, which could potentially lead to a date picker.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This action is intended to open a calendar or date selection interface, allowing navigation to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' option is currently visible in the opened side menu. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu (located at approximately [457, 221]) was successful. The side menu closed, and the app navigated to a view displaying tasks for \\'Today\\'. The title of the screen changed from \\'My Tasks\\' (when the side menu was open over it) to \\'Today\\'. This action brought the agent closer to the goal by changing the view, but it did not directly allow for selecting a specific date. The current view is for \\'Today\\', not October 16, 2023.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[86,107],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' title, located at the top of the screen (center at approximately [86, 107]). This is to check if tapping this element opens a date picker or calendar interface, which would allow navigation to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' title is currently visible. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Today\\' title at [86, 107] was unsuccessful. The screen remained unchanged, and no date picker or calendar interface appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 16, 2023. The next step will be to explore other UI elements for date navigation options.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This icon is part of the blue navigation bar at the bottom. This action is taken to open a menu, which might provide options to navigate to a specific date (October 16, 2023). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [943, 946] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared on the screen with options: \"Clear Completed\", \"Collapse subtasks\", \"Expand subtasks\", \"Show completed\", \"Show unstarted\", and \"Share\". However, none of these options provide a way to navigate to a specific date. This action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[86,149],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"My Tasks\" text, located at the top left of the screen (center at approximately [86, 149]). This is to check if tapping this element reveals any date navigation options or a way to switch views. The \"My Tasks\" text is currently visible. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'My Tasks\\' at [86, 149] failed. The screen remained unchanged, and no date navigation options or menus appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen, at approximately [945, 72]. This icon is part of the blue navigation bar at the bottom. This action is taken to open a menu or navigation drawer, which might provide options to navigate to a specific date (October 16, 2023). Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [945, 72] was successful. A side menu appeared on the left side of the screen, containing various navigation and filter options. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date by revealing a menu with a \\'Today\\' option, which could potentially lead to a date picker.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,221],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu, located at approximately [457, 221]. This action is intended to open a calendar or date selection interface, allowing navigation to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' option is currently visible in the opened side menu. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu (located at approximately [457, 221]) was successful. The side menu closed, and the app navigated to a view displaying tasks for \\'Today\\'. The title of the screen changed from \\'My Tasks\\' (when the side menu was open over it) to \\'Today\\'. This action brought the agent closer to the goal by changing the view, but it did not directly allow for selecting a specific date. The current view is for \\'Today\\', not October 16, 2023.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[86,107],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' title, located at the top of the screen (center at approximately [86, 107]). This is to check if tapping this element opens a date picker or calendar interface, which would allow navigation to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' title is currently visible. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Today\\' title at [86, 107] was unsuccessful. The screen remained unchanged, and no date picker or calendar interface appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 16, 2023. The next step will be to explore other UI elements for date navigation options.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[943,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [943, 946]). This icon is part of the blue navigation bar at the bottom. This action is taken to open a menu, which might provide options to navigate to a specific date (October 16, 2023). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [943, 946] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared on the screen with options: \"Clear Completed\", \"Collapse subtasks\", \"Expand subtasks\", \"Show completed\", \"Show unstarted\", and \"Share\". However, none of these options provide a way to navigate to a specific date. This action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the screen at coordinates [300, 300] to close the currently open context menu. The menu is located in the lower-right part of the screen, and tapping at [300, 300] (upper-left area) should dismiss it. This will return the view to the \\'Today\\' task list, allowing further actions for date navigation. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Tasks App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Tasks app is open and its main screen is visible, OR it\\'s determined that the Tasks app is not installed and `completedTaskTitles` in AgentMemory is updated to \\'Tasks app not found.\\'\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened, and the \\'Tasks\\' app was located.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen, at approximately [945, 72]. This icon is part of the blue navigation bar at the bottom. This action is taken to open a menu or navigation drawer, which might provide options to navigate to a specific date (October 16, 2023). Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [945, 72] was successful. A side menu appeared on the left side of the screen, containing various navigation and filter options. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date by revealing a menu with a \\'Today\\' option, which could potentially lead to a date picker.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,221],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu, located at approximately [457, 221]. This action is intended to open a calendar or date selection interface, allowing navigation to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' option is currently visible in the opened side menu. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu (located at approximately [457, 221]) was successful. The side menu closed, and the app navigated to a view displaying tasks for \\'Today\\'. The title of the screen changed from \\'My Tasks\\' (when the side menu was open over it) to \\'Today\\'. This action brought the agent closer to the goal by changing the view, but it did not directly allow for selecting a specific date. The current view is for \\'Today\\', not October 16, 2023.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[86,107],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' title, located at the top of the screen (center at approximately [86, 107]). This is to check if tapping this element opens a date picker or calendar interface, which would allow navigation to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' title is currently visible. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Today\\' title at [86, 107] was unsuccessful. The screen remained unchanged, and no date picker or calendar interface appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 16, 2023. The next step will be to explore other UI elements for date navigation options.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[943,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [943, 946]). This icon is part of the blue navigation bar at the bottom. This action is taken to open a menu, which might provide options to navigate to a specific date (October 16, 2023). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [943, 946] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared on the screen with options: \"Clear Completed\", \"Collapse subtasks\", \"Expand subtasks\", \"Show completed\", \"Show unstarted\", and \"Share\". However, none of these options provide a way to navigate to a specific date. This action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the screen at coordinates [300, 300] to close the currently open context menu. The menu is located in the lower-right part of the screen, and tapping at [300, 300] (upper-left area) should dismiss it. This will return the view to the \\'Today\\' task list, allowing further actions for date navigation. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [300, 300] successfully closed the pop-up menu. The screen returned to the \\'Today\\' view, displaying the list of tasks. This action was successful and necessary to clear the overlay before attempting further navigation actions. It brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the next planned step of swiping to change the date.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen, at approximately [945, 72]. This icon is part of the blue navigation bar at the bottom. This action is taken to open a menu or navigation drawer, which might provide options to navigate to a specific date (October 16, 2023). Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [945, 72] was successful. A side menu appeared on the left side of the screen, containing various navigation and filter options. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to a specific date by revealing a menu with a \\'Today\\' option, which could potentially lead to a date picker.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,221],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu, located at approximately [457, 221]. This action is intended to open a calendar or date selection interface, allowing navigation to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' option is currently visible in the opened side menu. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu (located at approximately [457, 221]) was successful. The side menu closed, and the app navigated to a view displaying tasks for \\'Today\\'. The title of the screen changed from \\'My Tasks\\' (when the side menu was open over it) to \\'Today\\'. This action brought the agent closer to the goal by changing the view, but it did not directly allow for selecting a specific date. The current view is for \\'Today\\', not October 16, 2023.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[86,107],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' title, located at the top of the screen (center at approximately [86, 107]). This is to check if tapping this element opens a date picker or calendar interface, which would allow navigation to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' title is currently visible. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Today\\' title at [86, 107] was unsuccessful. The screen remained unchanged, and no date picker or calendar interface appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 16, 2023. The next step will be to explore other UI elements for date navigation options.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[943,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [943, 946]). This icon is part of the blue navigation bar at the bottom. This action is taken to open a menu, which might provide options to navigate to a specific date (October 16, 2023). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [943, 946] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared on the screen with options: \"Clear Completed\", \"Collapse subtasks\", \"Expand subtasks\", \"Show completed\", \"Show unstarted\", and \"Share\". However, none of these options provide a way to navigate to a specific date. This action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the screen at coordinates [300, 300] to close the currently open context menu. The menu is located in the lower-right part of the screen, and tapping at [300, 300] (upper-left area) should dismiss it. This will return the view to the \\'Today\\' task list, allowing further actions for date navigation. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [300, 300] successfully closed the pop-up menu. The screen returned to the \\'Today\\' view, displaying the list of tasks. This action was successful and necessary to clear the overlay before attempting further navigation actions. It brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the next planned step of swiping to change the date.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,700],\"end_point\":[500,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from right to left across the middle of the screen (from [500, 700] to [500, 300]). This action is an attempt to navigate to the previous day\\'s task list. The current screen shows tasks for \\'Today\\'. The prediction is that the displayed date will change, hopefully to \\'Yesterday\\' or a specific past date, bringing the agent closer to October 16, 2023. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Tasks App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Tasks app is open and its main screen is visible, OR it\\'s determined that the Tasks app is not installed and `completedTaskTitles` in AgentMemory is updated to \\'Tasks app not found.\\'\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened, and the \\'Tasks\\' app was located.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,221],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu, located at approximately [457, 221]. This action is intended to open a calendar or date selection interface, allowing navigation to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' option is currently visible in the opened side menu. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu (located at approximately [457, 221]) was successful. The side menu closed, and the app navigated to a view displaying tasks for \\'Today\\'. The title of the screen changed from \\'My Tasks\\' (when the side menu was open over it) to \\'Today\\'. This action brought the agent closer to the goal by changing the view, but it did not directly allow for selecting a specific date. The current view is for \\'Today\\', not October 16, 2023.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[86,107],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' title, located at the top of the screen (center at approximately [86, 107]). This is to check if tapping this element opens a date picker or calendar interface, which would allow navigation to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' title is currently visible. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Today\\' title at [86, 107] was unsuccessful. The screen remained unchanged, and no date picker or calendar interface appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 16, 2023. The next step will be to explore other UI elements for date navigation options.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[943,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [943, 946]). This icon is part of the blue navigation bar at the bottom. This action is taken to open a menu, which might provide options to navigate to a specific date (October 16, 2023). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [943, 946] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared on the screen with options: \"Clear Completed\", \"Collapse subtasks\", \"Expand subtasks\", \"Show completed\", \"Show unstarted\", and \"Share\". However, none of these options provide a way to navigate to a specific date. This action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the screen at coordinates [300, 300] to close the currently open context menu. The menu is located in the lower-right part of the screen, and tapping at [300, 300] (upper-left area) should dismiss it. This will return the view to the \\'Today\\' task list, allowing further actions for date navigation. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [300, 300] successfully closed the pop-up menu. The screen returned to the \\'Today\\' view, displaying the list of tasks. This action was successful and necessary to clear the overlay before attempting further navigation actions. It brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the next planned step of swiping to change the date.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,700],\"end_point\":[500,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from right to left across the middle of the screen (from [500, 700] to [500, 300]). This action is an attempt to navigate to the previous day\\'s task list. The current screen shows tasks for \\'Today\\'. The prediction is that the displayed date will change, hopefully to \\'Yesterday\\' or a specific past date, bringing the agent closer to October 16, 2023. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from right to left (coordinates [500, 700] to [500, 300]) was performed. The screen did not change; the \\'Today\\' view is still displayed, and the date did not update. Therefore, this action was unsuccessful in bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. The next step is to attempt a swipe in the opposite direction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.44\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 253], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: -432.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 66, 538], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: -0.432\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 31, 102, 183], \\'text\\': \\'Today\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [135, 131, 157, 414], \\'text\\': \\'Organize Closet\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [138, 903, 153, 965], \\'text\\': \\'Thu\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [198, 133, 221, 512], \\'text\\': \\'Attend Team Meeting\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [201, 894, 217, 963], \\'text\\': \\'Wed\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [262, 135, 280, 359], \\'text\\': \\'Water Plants\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [265, 905, 280, 965], \\'text\\': \\'Tue\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [288, 131, 329, 934], \\'text\\': \\'Check moisture level before watering.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,221],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu, located at approximately [457, 221]. This action is intended to open a calendar or date selection interface, allowing navigation to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' option is currently visible in the opened side menu. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu (located at approximately [457, 221]) was successful. The side menu closed, and the app navigated to a view displaying tasks for \\'Today\\'. The title of the screen changed from \\'My Tasks\\' (when the side menu was open over it) to \\'Today\\'. This action brought the agent closer to the goal by changing the view, but it did not directly allow for selecting a specific date. The current view is for \\'Today\\', not October 16, 2023.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[86,107],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' title, located at the top of the screen (center at approximately [86, 107]). This is to check if tapping this element opens a date picker or calendar interface, which would allow navigation to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' title is currently visible. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Today\\' title at [86, 107] was unsuccessful. The screen remained unchanged, and no date picker or calendar interface appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 16, 2023. The next step will be to explore other UI elements for date navigation options.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[943,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [943, 946]). This icon is part of the blue navigation bar at the bottom. This action is taken to open a menu, which might provide options to navigate to a specific date (October 16, 2023). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [943, 946] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared on the screen with options: \"Clear Completed\", \"Collapse subtasks\", \"Expand subtasks\", \"Show completed\", \"Show unstarted\", and \"Share\". However, none of these options provide a way to navigate to a specific date. This action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the screen at coordinates [300, 300] to close the currently open context menu. The menu is located in the lower-right part of the screen, and tapping at [300, 300] (upper-left area) should dismiss it. This will return the view to the \\'Today\\' task list, allowing further actions for date navigation. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [300, 300] successfully closed the pop-up menu. The screen returned to the \\'Today\\' view, displaying the list of tasks. This action was successful and necessary to clear the overlay before attempting further navigation actions. It brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the next planned step of swiping to change the date.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,700],\"end_point\":[500,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from right to left across the middle of the screen (from [500, 700] to [500, 300]). This action is an attempt to navigate to the previous day\\'s task list. The current screen shows tasks for \\'Today\\'. The prediction is that the displayed date will change, hopefully to \\'Yesterday\\' or a specific past date, bringing the agent closer to October 16, 2023. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from right to left (coordinates [500, 700] to [500, 300]) was performed. The screen did not change; the \\'Today\\' view is still displayed, and the date did not update. Therefore, this action was unsuccessful in bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. The next step is to attempt a swipe in the opposite direction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 13: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,300],\"end_point\":[500,700],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from left to right across the middle of the screen (from [500, 300] to [500, 700]). This action is an attempt to navigate to the next day\\'s task list (or previous, depending on app logic, but the goal is to change the date). The current screen shows tasks for \\'Today\\'. The prediction is that the displayed date will change, hopefully to \\'Tomorrow\\' or a specific future date, or potentially \\'Yesterday\\' if the app\\'s swipe logic is reversed from the previous attempt. This will help determine if swiping is a valid navigation method for dates. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Tasks App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Tasks app is open and its main screen is visible, OR it\\'s determined that the Tasks app is not installed and `completedTaskTitles` in AgentMemory is updated to \\'Tasks app not found.\\'\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened, and the \\'Tasks\\' app was located.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is to check if tapping this element opens a date picker or calendar interface, which would allow navigation to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' title is currently visible. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Today\\' title at [86, 107] was unsuccessful. The screen remained unchanged, and no date picker or calendar interface appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 16, 2023. The next step will be to explore other UI elements for date navigation options.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[943,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [943, 946]). This icon is part of the blue navigation bar at the bottom. This action is taken to open a menu, which might provide options to navigate to a specific date (October 16, 2023). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [943, 946] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared on the screen with options: \"Clear Completed\", \"Collapse subtasks\", \"Expand subtasks\", \"Show completed\", \"Show unstarted\", and \"Share\". However, none of these options provide a way to navigate to a specific date. This action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the screen at coordinates [300, 300] to close the currently open context menu. The menu is located in the lower-right part of the screen, and tapping at [300, 300] (upper-left area) should dismiss it. This will return the view to the \\'Today\\' task list, allowing further actions for date navigation. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [300, 300] successfully closed the pop-up menu. The screen returned to the \\'Today\\' view, displaying the list of tasks. This action was successful and necessary to clear the overlay before attempting further navigation actions. It brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the next planned step of swiping to change the date.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,700],\"end_point\":[500,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from right to left across the middle of the screen (from [500, 700] to [500, 300]). This action is an attempt to navigate to the previous day\\'s task list. The current screen shows tasks for \\'Today\\'. The prediction is that the displayed date will change, hopefully to \\'Yesterday\\' or a specific past date, bringing the agent closer to October 16, 2023. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from right to left (coordinates [500, 700] to [500, 300]) was performed. The screen did not change; the \\'Today\\' view is still displayed, and the date did not update. Therefore, this action was unsuccessful in bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. The next step is to attempt a swipe in the opposite direction.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,300],\"end_point\":[500,700],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from left to right across the middle of the screen (from [500, 300] to [500, 700]). This action is an attempt to navigate to the next day\\'s task list (or previous, depending on app logic, but the goal is to change the date). The current screen shows tasks for \\'Today\\'. The prediction is that the displayed date will change, hopefully to \\'Tomorrow\\' or a specific future date, or potentially \\'Yesterday\\' if the app\\'s swipe logic is reversed from the previous attempt. This will help determine if swiping is a valid navigation method for dates. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from left to right (coordinates [500, 300] to [500, 700]) was performed. The screen did not change; the \\'Today\\' view is still displayed, and the date did not update. Therefore, this action was unsuccessful in bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. This confirms that horizontal swiping on the main task list is not the method for changing dates in this app.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is to check if tapping this element opens a date picker or calendar interface, which would allow navigation to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' title is currently visible. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Today\\' title at [86, 107] was unsuccessful. The screen remained unchanged, and no date picker or calendar interface appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 16, 2023. The next step will be to explore other UI elements for date navigation options.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[943,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [943, 946]). This icon is part of the blue navigation bar at the bottom. This action is taken to open a menu, which might provide options to navigate to a specific date (October 16, 2023). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [943, 946] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared on the screen with options: \"Clear Completed\", \"Collapse subtasks\", \"Expand subtasks\", \"Show completed\", \"Show unstarted\", and \"Share\". However, none of these options provide a way to navigate to a specific date. This action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the screen at coordinates [300, 300] to close the currently open context menu. The menu is located in the lower-right part of the screen, and tapping at [300, 300] (upper-left area) should dismiss it. This will return the view to the \\'Today\\' task list, allowing further actions for date navigation. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [300, 300] successfully closed the pop-up menu. The screen returned to the \\'Today\\' view, displaying the list of tasks. This action was successful and necessary to clear the overlay before attempting further navigation actions. It brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the next planned step of swiping to change the date.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,700],\"end_point\":[500,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from right to left across the middle of the screen (from [500, 700] to [500, 300]). This action is an attempt to navigate to the previous day\\'s task list. The current screen shows tasks for \\'Today\\'. The prediction is that the displayed date will change, hopefully to \\'Yesterday\\' or a specific past date, bringing the agent closer to October 16, 2023. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from right to left (coordinates [500, 700] to [500, 300]) was performed. The screen did not change; the \\'Today\\' view is still displayed, and the date did not update. Therefore, this action was unsuccessful in bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. The next step is to attempt a swipe in the opposite direction.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,300],\"end_point\":[500,700],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from left to right across the middle of the screen (from [500, 300] to [500, 700]). This action is an attempt to navigate to the next day\\'s task list (or previous, depending on app logic, but the goal is to change the date). The current screen shows tasks for \\'Today\\'. The prediction is that the displayed date will change, hopefully to \\'Tomorrow\\' or a specific future date, or potentially \\'Yesterday\\' if the app\\'s swipe logic is reversed from the previous attempt. This will help determine if swiping is a valid navigation method for dates. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from left to right (coordinates [500, 300] to [500, 700]) was performed. The screen did not change; the \\'Today\\' view is still displayed, and the date did not update. Therefore, this action was unsuccessful in bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. This confirms that horizontal swiping on the main task list is not the method for changing dates in this app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 14: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (approximate center [945, 72]). This is to reopen the side menu and look for options to navigate to a specific date, such as a calendar view or a \\'go to date\\' feature, which might have been overlooked previously. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Tasks App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Tasks app is open and its main screen is visible, OR it\\'s determined that the Tasks app is not installed and `completedTaskTitles` in AgentMemory is updated to \\'Tasks app not found.\\'\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened, and the \\'Tasks\\' app was located.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This icon is part of the blue navigation bar at the bottom. This action is taken to open a menu, which might provide options to navigate to a specific date (October 16, 2023). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [943, 946] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared on the screen with options: \"Clear Completed\", \"Collapse subtasks\", \"Expand subtasks\", \"Show completed\", \"Show unstarted\", and \"Share\".

The menu is located in the lower-right part of the screen, and tapping at [300, 300] (upper-left area) should dismiss it. This will return the view to the \\'Today\\' task list, allowing further actions for date navigation. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [300, 300] successfully closed the pop-up menu. The screen returned to the \\'Today\\' view, displaying the list of tasks. This action was successful and necessary to clear the overlay before attempting further navigation actions. It brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the next planned step of swiping to change the date.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,700],\"end_point\":[500,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from right to left across the middle of the screen (from [500, 700] to [500, 300]). This action is an attempt to navigate to the previous day\\'s task list. The current screen shows tasks for \\'Today\\'. The prediction is that the displayed date will change, hopefully to \\'Yesterday\\' or a specific past date, bringing the agent closer to October 16, 2023. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from right to left (coordinates [500, 700] to [500, 300]) was performed. The screen did not change; the \\'Today\\' view is still displayed, and the date did not update. Therefore, this action was unsuccessful in bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023.

This action is an attempt to navigate to the next day\\'s task list (or previous, depending on app logic, but the goal is to change the date). The current screen shows tasks for \\'Today\\'. The prediction is that the displayed date will change, hopefully to \\'Tomorrow\\' or a specific future date, or potentially \\'Yesterday\\' if the app\\'s swipe logic is reversed from the previous attempt. This will help determine if swiping is a valid navigation method for dates. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from left to right (coordinates [500, 300] to [500, 700]) was performed. The screen did not change; the \\'Today\\' view is still displayed, and the date did not update. Therefore, this action was unsuccessful in bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. This confirms that horizontal swiping on the main task list is not the method for changing dates in this app.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (approximate center [945, 72]). This is to reopen the side menu and look for options to navigate to a specific date, such as a calendar view or a \\'go to date\\' feature, which might have been overlooked previously. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [945, 72] was successful. A side menu appeared on the left side of the screen. This menu contains various navigation and filtering options, including a \\'Today\\' option with a calendar icon. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 16, 2023, as this menu is likely to contain the necessary tools for date navigation. The next step is to interact with the \\'Today\\' option in this side menu.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[943,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [943, 946]). This icon is part of the blue navigation bar at the bottom. This action is taken to open a menu, which might provide options to navigate to a specific date (October 16, 2023). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [943, 946] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared on the screen with options: \"Clear Completed\", \"Collapse subtasks\", \"Expand subtasks\", \"Show completed\", \"Show unstarted\", and \"Share\". However, none of these options provide a way to navigate to a specific date. This action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the screen at coordinates [300, 300] to close the currently open context menu. The menu is located in the lower-right part of the screen, and tapping at [300, 300] (upper-left area) should dismiss it. This will return the view to the \\'Today\\' task list, allowing further actions for date navigation. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [300, 300] successfully closed the pop-up menu. The screen returned to the \\'Today\\' view, displaying the list of tasks. This action was successful and necessary to clear the overlay before attempting further navigation actions. It brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the next planned step of swiping to change the date.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,700],\"end_point\":[500,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from right to left across the middle of the screen (from [500, 700] to [500, 300]). This action is an attempt to navigate to the previous day\\'s task list. The current screen shows tasks for \\'Today\\'. The prediction is that the displayed date will change, hopefully to \\'Yesterday\\' or a specific past date, bringing the agent closer to October 16, 2023. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from right to left (coordinates [500, 700] to [500, 300]) was performed. The screen did not change; the \\'Today\\' view is still displayed, and the date did not update. Therefore, this action was unsuccessful in bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. The next step is to attempt a swipe in the opposite direction.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,300],\"end_point\":[500,700],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from left to right across the middle of the screen (from [500, 300] to [500, 700]). This action is an attempt to navigate to the next day\\'s task list (or previous, depending on app logic, but the goal is to change the date). The current screen shows tasks for \\'Today\\'. The prediction is that the displayed date will change, hopefully to \\'Tomorrow\\' or a specific future date, or potentially \\'Yesterday\\' if the app\\'s swipe logic is reversed from the previous attempt. This will help determine if swiping is a valid navigation method for dates. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from left to right (coordinates [500, 300] to [500, 700]) was performed. The screen did not change; the \\'Today\\' view is still displayed, and the date did not update. Therefore, this action was unsuccessful in bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. This confirms that horizontal swiping on the main task list is not the method for changing dates in this app.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (approximate center [945, 72]). This is to reopen the side menu and look for options to navigate to a specific date, such as a calendar view or a \\'go to date\\' feature, which might have been overlooked previously. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [945, 72] was successful. A side menu appeared on the left side of the screen. This menu contains various navigation and filtering options, including a \\'Today\\' option with a calendar icon. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 16, 2023, as this menu is likely to contain the necessary tools for date navigation. The next step is to interact with the \\'Today\\' option in this side menu.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 15: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,221],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu. The text \\'Today\\' is located at approximately [457, 221]. This action is taken to attempt to open a date picker or calendar view to navigate to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' option is currently highlighted, indicating it\\'s the active view.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This indicates that the 'Today' option in the side menu is a direct navigation link to the 'Today' view, not a feature for selecting other dates.\\n\\nThe active subgoal is to navigate to October 16, 2023. Since tapping 'Today' in the side menu did not achieve this, the plan needs to be revised. The next logical step is to re-open the side menu and explore other potentially relevant options. The 'Filters' option within the side menu is a plausible candidate for finding date-based filtering or navigation capabilities.\\n\\nThe updated plan is:\\n1. Tap the hamburger menu icon at the bottom left (previously identified around [945, 72]) to reopen the side menu.\\n2. Once the side menu is open, tap on the 'Filters' option.\\n3. Investigate the 'Filters' section to see if it allows selection or navigation to a specific date like October 16, 2023.\\n4.

The menu is located in the lower-right part of the screen, and tapping at [300, 300] (upper-left area) should dismiss it. This will return the view to the \\'Today\\' task list, allowing further actions for date navigation. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [300, 300] successfully closed the pop-up menu. The screen returned to the \\'Today\\' view, displaying the list of tasks. This action was successful and necessary to clear the overlay before attempting further navigation actions. It brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the next planned step of swiping to change the date.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,700],\"end_point\":[500,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from right to left across the middle of the screen (from [500, 700] to [500, 300]). This action is an attempt to navigate to the previous day\\'s task list. The current screen shows tasks for \\'Today\\'. The prediction is that the displayed date will change, hopefully to \\'Yesterday\\' or a specific past date, bringing the agent closer to October 16, 2023. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from right to left (coordinates [500, 700] to [500, 300]) was performed. The screen did not change; the \\'Today\\' view is still displayed, and the date did not update. Therefore, this action was unsuccessful in bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. The next step is to attempt a swipe in the opposite direction.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,300],\"end_point\":[500,700],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from left to right across the middle of the screen (from [500, 300] to [500, 700]). This action is an attempt to navigate to the next day\\'s task list (or previous, depending on app logic, but the goal is to change the date). The current screen shows tasks for \\'Today\\'. The prediction is that the displayed date will change, hopefully to \\'Tomorrow\\' or a specific future date, or potentially \\'Yesterday\\' if the app\\'s swipe logic is reversed from the previous attempt. This will help determine if swiping is a valid navigation method for dates. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from left to right (coordinates [500, 300] to [500, 700]) was performed. The screen did not change; the \\'Today\\' view is still displayed, and the date did not update. Therefore, this action was unsuccessful in bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. This confirms that horizontal swiping on the main task list is not the method for changing dates in this app.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (approximate center [945, 72]). This is to reopen the side menu and look for options to navigate to a specific date, such as a calendar view or a \\'go to date\\' feature, which might have been overlooked previously. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [945, 72] was successful. A side menu appeared on the left side of the screen. This menu contains various navigation and filtering options, including a \\'Today\\' option with a calendar icon. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 16, 2023, as this menu is likely to contain the necessary tools for date navigation. The next step is to interact with the \\'Today\\' option in this side menu.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,221],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu. The text \\'Today\\' is located at approximately [457, 221]. This action is taken to attempt to open a date picker or calendar view to navigate to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' option is currently highlighted, indicating it\\'s the active view. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the \\'Today\\' option, located at approximately [457, 221] within the open side menu. This action successfully closed the side menu. The application returned to the main \\'Today\\' task list view. Crucially, this action did not open a date picker, calendar, or any other interface for selecting a specific date. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. To proceed, the side menu needs to be reopened to explore alternative navigation options.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the screen at coordinates [300, 300] to close the currently open context menu. The menu is located in the lower-right part of the screen, and tapping at [300, 300] (upper-left area) should dismiss it. This will return the view to the \\'Today\\' task list, allowing further actions for date navigation. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [300, 300] successfully closed the pop-up menu. The screen returned to the \\'Today\\' view, displaying the list of tasks. This action was successful and necessary to clear the overlay before attempting further navigation actions. It brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the next planned step of swiping to change the date.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,700],\"end_point\":[500,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from right to left across the middle of the screen (from [500, 700] to [500, 300]). This action is an attempt to navigate to the previous day\\'s task list. The current screen shows tasks for \\'Today\\'. The prediction is that the displayed date will change, hopefully to \\'Yesterday\\' or a specific past date, bringing the agent closer to October 16, 2023. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from right to left (coordinates [500, 700] to [500, 300]) was performed. The screen did not change; the \\'Today\\' view is still displayed, and the date did not update. Therefore, this action was unsuccessful in bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. The next step is to attempt a swipe in the opposite direction.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,300],\"end_point\":[500,700],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from left to right across the middle of the screen (from [500, 300] to [500, 700]). This action is an attempt to navigate to the next day\\'s task list (or previous, depending on app logic, but the goal is to change the date). The current screen shows tasks for \\'Today\\'. The prediction is that the displayed date will change, hopefully to \\'Tomorrow\\' or a specific future date, or potentially \\'Yesterday\\' if the app\\'s swipe logic is reversed from the previous attempt. This will help determine if swiping is a valid navigation method for dates. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from left to right (coordinates [500, 300] to [500, 700]) was performed. The screen did not change; the \\'Today\\' view is still displayed, and the date did not update. Therefore, this action was unsuccessful in bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. This confirms that horizontal swiping on the main task list is not the method for changing dates in this app.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (approximate center [945, 72]). This is to reopen the side menu and look for options to navigate to a specific date, such as a calendar view or a \\'go to date\\' feature, which might have been overlooked previously. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [945, 72] was successful. A side menu appeared on the left side of the screen. This menu contains various navigation and filtering options, including a \\'Today\\' option with a calendar icon. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 16, 2023, as this menu is likely to contain the necessary tools for date navigation. The next step is to interact with the \\'Today\\' option in this side menu.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,221],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu. The text \\'Today\\' is located at approximately [457, 221]. This action is taken to attempt to open a date picker or calendar view to navigate to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' option is currently highlighted, indicating it\\'s the active view. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the \\'Today\\' option, located at approximately [457, 221] within the open side menu. This action successfully closed the side menu. The application returned to the main \\'Today\\' task list view. Crucially, this action did not open a date picker, calendar, or any other interface for selecting a specific date. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. To proceed, the side menu needs to be reopened to explore alternative navigation options.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 16: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (approximate center [945, 72]).

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The prediction is that the displayed date will change, hopefully to \\'Yesterday\\' or a specific past date, bringing the agent closer to October 16, 2023. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from right to left (coordinates [500, 700] to [500, 300]) was performed. The screen did not change; the \\'Today\\' view is still displayed, and the date did not update. Therefore, this action was unsuccessful in bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023.

This action is an attempt to navigate to the next day\\'s task list (or previous, depending on app logic, but the goal is to change the date). The current screen shows tasks for \\'Today\\'. The prediction is that the displayed date will change, hopefully to \\'Tomorrow\\' or a specific future date, or potentially \\'Yesterday\\' if the app\\'s swipe logic is reversed from the previous attempt. This will help determine if swiping is a valid navigation method for dates. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from left to right (coordinates [500, 300] to [500, 700]) was performed. The screen did not change; the \\'Today\\' view is still displayed, and the date did not update. Therefore, this action was unsuccessful in bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. This confirms that horizontal swiping on the main task list is not the method for changing dates in this app.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (approximate center [945, 72]). This is to reopen the side menu and look for options to navigate to a specific date, such as a calendar view or a \\'go to date\\' feature, which might have been overlooked previously. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [945, 72] was successful. A side menu appeared on the left side of the screen. This menu contains various navigation and filtering options, including a \\'Today\\' option with a calendar icon. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 16, 2023, as this menu is likely to contain the necessary tools for date navigation. The next step is to interact with the \\'Today\\' option in this side menu.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,221],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu. The text \\'Today\\' is located at approximately [457, 221]. This action is taken to attempt to open a date picker or calendar view to navigate to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' option is currently highlighted, indicating it\\'s the active view. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the \\'Today\\' option, located at approximately [457, 221] within the open side menu. This action successfully closed the side menu. The application returned to the main \\'Today\\' task list view. Crucially, this action did not open a date picker, calendar, or any other interface for selecting a specific date. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. To proceed, the side menu needs to be reopened to explore alternative navigation options.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (approximate center [945, 72]). This action is intended to re-open the side menu, which may contain options for navigating to a specific date, such as a \\'Filters\\' section or a calendar view. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [945, 72] successfully opened the side menu on the left side of the screen.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,700],\"end_point\":[500,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from right to left across the middle of the screen (from [500, 700] to [500, 300]). This action is an attempt to navigate to the previous day\\'s task list. The current screen shows tasks for \\'Today\\'. The prediction is that the displayed date will change, hopefully to \\'Yesterday\\' or a specific past date, bringing the agent closer to October 16, 2023. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from right to left (coordinates [500, 700] to [500, 300]) was performed. The screen did not change; the \\'Today\\' view is still displayed, and the date did not update. Therefore, this action was unsuccessful in bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. The next step is to attempt a swipe in the opposite direction.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,300],\"end_point\":[500,700],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from left to right across the middle of the screen (from [500, 300] to [500, 700]). This action is an attempt to navigate to the next day\\'s task list (or previous, depending on app logic, but the goal is to change the date). The current screen shows tasks for \\'Today\\'. The prediction is that the displayed date will change, hopefully to \\'Tomorrow\\' or a specific future date, or potentially \\'Yesterday\\' if the app\\'s swipe logic is reversed from the previous attempt. This will help determine if swiping is a valid navigation method for dates. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from left to right (coordinates [500, 300] to [500, 700]) was performed. The screen did not change; the \\'Today\\' view is still displayed, and the date did not update. Therefore, this action was unsuccessful in bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. This confirms that horizontal swiping on the main task list is not the method for changing dates in this app.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (approximate center [945, 72]). This is to reopen the side menu and look for options to navigate to a specific date, such as a calendar view or a \\'go to date\\' feature, which might have been overlooked previously. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [945, 72] was successful. A side menu appeared on the left side of the screen. This menu contains various navigation and filtering options, including a \\'Today\\' option with a calendar icon. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 16, 2023, as this menu is likely to contain the necessary tools for date navigation. The next step is to interact with the \\'Today\\' option in this side menu.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,221],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu. The text \\'Today\\' is located at approximately [457, 221]. This action is taken to attempt to open a date picker or calendar view to navigate to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' option is currently highlighted, indicating it\\'s the active view. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the \\'Today\\' option, located at approximately [457, 221] within the open side menu. This action successfully closed the side menu. The application returned to the main \\'Today\\' task list view. Crucially, this action did not open a date picker, calendar, or any other interface for selecting a specific date. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. To proceed, the side menu needs to be reopened to explore alternative navigation options.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (approximate center [945, 72]). This action is intended to re-open the side menu, which may contain options for navigating to a specific date, such as a \\'Filters\\' section or a calendar view. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [945, 72] successfully opened the side menu on the left side of the screen. This menu displays various options, including \\'My Tasks\\', \\'Filters\\', \\'Today\\', etc. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to navigating to the desired date by providing access to potential date navigation tools within the menu.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 17: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[403,87],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Filters\\' option in the open side menu. The text \\'Filters\\' is located at approximately [403, 87]. This action is taken to explore if the \\'Filters\\' section provides a way to navigate to a specific date, such as October 16, 2023. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Tasks App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Tasks app is open and its main screen is visible, OR it\\'s determined that the Tasks app is not installed and `completedTaskTitles` in AgentMemory is updated to \\'Tasks app not found.\\'\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened, and the \\'Tasks\\' app was located.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The tap successfully interacted with the 'Filters' UI element.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,300],\"end_point\":[500,700],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from left to right across the middle of the screen (from [500, 300] to [500, 700]). This action is an attempt to navigate to the next day\\'s task list (or previous, depending on app logic, but the goal is to change the date). The current screen shows tasks for \\'Today\\'. The prediction is that the displayed date will change, hopefully to \\'Tomorrow\\' or a specific future date, or potentially \\'Yesterday\\' if the app\\'s swipe logic is reversed from the previous attempt. This will help determine if swiping is a valid navigation method for dates. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from left to right (coordinates [500, 300] to [500, 700]) was performed. The screen did not change; the \\'Today\\' view is still displayed, and the date did not update. Therefore, this action was unsuccessful in bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. This confirms that horizontal swiping on the main task list is not the method for changing dates in this app.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (approximate center [945, 72]). This is to reopen the side menu and look for options to navigate to a specific date, such as a calendar view or a \\'go to date\\' feature, which might have been overlooked previously. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [945, 72] was successful. A side menu appeared on the left side of the screen. This menu contains various navigation and filtering options, including a \\'Today\\' option with a calendar icon. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 16, 2023, as this menu is likely to contain the necessary tools for date navigation. The next step is to interact with the \\'Today\\' option in this side menu.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,221],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu. The text \\'Today\\' is located at approximately [457, 221]. This action is taken to attempt to open a date picker or calendar view to navigate to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' option is currently highlighted, indicating it\\'s the active view. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the \\'Today\\' option, located at approximately [457, 221] within the open side menu. This action successfully closed the side menu. The application returned to the main \\'Today\\' task list view. Crucially, this action did not open a date picker, calendar, or any other interface for selecting a specific date. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. To proceed, the side menu needs to be reopened to explore alternative navigation options.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (approximate center [945, 72]). This action is intended to re-open the side menu, which may contain options for navigating to a specific date, such as a \\'Filters\\' section or a calendar view. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [945, 72] successfully opened the side menu on the left side of the screen. This menu displays various options, including \\'My Tasks\\', \\'Filters\\', \\'Today\\', etc. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to navigating to the desired date by providing access to potential date navigation tools within the menu.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[403,87],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Filters\\' option in the open side menu. The text \\'Filters\\' is located at approximately [403, 87]. This action is taken to explore if the \\'Filters\\' section provides a way to navigate to a specific date, such as October 16, 2023. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the \\'Filters\\' option in the side menu at approximately [403, 87]. This action successfully interacted with the element. As a result, the side menu changed: the arrow icon next to \\'Filters\\' changed from pointing upwards to pointing downwards, suggesting the \\'Filters\\' section is now active or expanded. Crucially, the \\'Today\\' option, which was previously visible and featured a calendar icon, is no longer visible in the menu. \\'My Tasks\\' is now displayed at the top of the visible menu items. This action did not directly reveal a date picker or calendar. It has modified the state of the side menu. The immediate goal is to find a way to navigate to the specific date, and the next step should be to investigate if this new state of \\'Filters\\' allows date navigation or to try to revert to the previous menu state to access the \\'Today\\' option again.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,300],\"end_point\":[500,700],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from left to right across the middle of the screen (from [500, 300] to [500, 700]). This action is an attempt to navigate to the next day\\'s task list (or previous, depending on app logic, but the goal is to change the date). The current screen shows tasks for \\'Today\\'. The prediction is that the displayed date will change, hopefully to \\'Tomorrow\\' or a specific future date, or potentially \\'Yesterday\\' if the app\\'s swipe logic is reversed from the previous attempt. This will help determine if swiping is a valid navigation method for dates. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from left to right (coordinates [500, 300] to [500, 700]) was performed. The screen did not change; the \\'Today\\' view is still displayed, and the date did not update. Therefore, this action was unsuccessful in bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. This confirms that horizontal swiping on the main task list is not the method for changing dates in this app.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (approximate center [945, 72]). This is to reopen the side menu and look for options to navigate to a specific date, such as a calendar view or a \\'go to date\\' feature, which might have been overlooked previously. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [945, 72] was successful. A side menu appeared on the left side of the screen. This menu contains various navigation and filtering options, including a \\'Today\\' option with a calendar icon. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 16, 2023, as this menu is likely to contain the necessary tools for date navigation. The next step is to interact with the \\'Today\\' option in this side menu.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,221],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu. The text \\'Today\\' is located at approximately [457, 221]. This action is taken to attempt to open a date picker or calendar view to navigate to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' option is currently highlighted, indicating it\\'s the active view. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the \\'Today\\' option, located at approximately [457, 221] within the open side menu. This action successfully closed the side menu. The application returned to the main \\'Today\\' task list view. Crucially, this action did not open a date picker, calendar, or any other interface for selecting a specific date. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. To proceed, the side menu needs to be reopened to explore alternative navigation options.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (approximate center [945, 72]). This action is intended to re-open the side menu, which may contain options for navigating to a specific date, such as a \\'Filters\\' section or a calendar view. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [945, 72] successfully opened the side menu on the left side of the screen. This menu displays various options, including \\'My Tasks\\', \\'Filters\\', \\'Today\\', etc. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to navigating to the desired date by providing access to potential date navigation tools within the menu.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[403,87],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Filters\\' option in the open side menu. The text \\'Filters\\' is located at approximately [403, 87]. This action is taken to explore if the \\'Filters\\' section provides a way to navigate to a specific date, such as October 16, 2023. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the \\'Filters\\' option in the side menu at approximately [403, 87]. This action successfully interacted with the element. As a result, the side menu changed: the arrow icon next to \\'Filters\\' changed from pointing upwards to pointing downwards, suggesting the \\'Filters\\' section is now active or expanded. Crucially, the \\'Today\\' option, which was previously visible and featured a calendar icon, is no longer visible in the menu. \\'My Tasks\\' is now displayed at the top of the visible menu items. This action did not directly reveal a date picker or calendar. It has modified the state of the side menu. The immediate goal is to find a way to navigate to the specific date, and the next step should be to investigate if this new state of \\'Filters\\' allows date navigation or to try to revert to the previous menu state to access the \\'Today\\' option again.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 18: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[508,87],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Filters\\' option in the side menu (text \\'Filters\\' at approx [508, 87]). The \\'Filters\\' section is currently expanded (arrow pointing down). This tap is intended to collapse the \\'Filters\\' section, which should change the arrow to point up and potentially reveal the \\'Today\\' option with the calendar icon again, or other date navigation options. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Tasks App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Tasks app is open and its main screen is visible, OR it\\'s determined that the Tasks app is not installed and `completedTaskTitles` in AgentMemory is updated to \\'Tasks app not found.\\'\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened, and the \\'Tasks\\' app was located.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is to reopen the side menu and look for options to navigate to a specific date, such as a calendar view or a \\'go to date\\' feature, which might have been overlooked previously. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [945, 72] was successful. A side menu appeared on the left side of the screen. This menu contains various navigation and filtering options, including a \\'Today\\' option with a calendar icon. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 16, 2023, as this menu is likely to contain the necessary tools for date navigation. The next step is to interact with the \\'Today\\' option in this side menu.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,221],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the side menu. The text \\'Today\\' is located at approximately [457, 221]. This action is taken to attempt to open a date picker or calendar view to navigate to October 16, 2023. The \\'Today\\' option is currently highlighted, indicating it\\'s the active view. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the \\'Today\\' option, located at approximately [457, 221] within the open side menu. This action successfully closed the side menu. The application returned to the main \\'Today\\' task list view. Crucially, this action did not open a date picker, calendar, or any other interface for selecting a specific date. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 16, 2023. To proceed, the side menu needs to be reopened to explore alternative navigation options.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,72],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (approximate center [945, 72]). This action is intended to re-open the side menu, which may contain options for navigating to a specific date, such as a \\'Filters\\' section or a calendar view. Actual Outcome: The tap on the hamburger menu icon at [945, 72] successfully opened the side menu on the left side of the screen. This menu displays various options, including \\'My Tasks\\', \\'Filters\\', \\'Today\\', etc. This action was successful and brings the agent closer to navigating to the desired date by providing access to potential date navigation tools within the menu.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[403,87],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Filters\\' option in the open side menu. The text \\'Filters\\' is located at approximately [403, 87]. This action is taken to explore if the \\'Filters\\' section provides a way to navigate to a specific date, such as October 16, 2023. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the \\'Filters\\' option in the side menu at approximately [403, 87]. This action successfully interacted with the element. As a result, the side menu changed: the arrow icon next to \\'Filters\\' changed from pointing upwards to pointing downwards, suggesting the \\'Filters\\' section is now active or expanded. Crucially, the \\'Today\\' option, which was previously visible and featured a calendar icon, is no longer visible in the menu. \\'My Tasks\\' is now displayed at the top of the visible menu items. This action did not directly reveal a date picker or calendar. It has modified the state of the side menu. The immediate goal is to find a way to navigate to the specific date, and the next step should be to investigate if this new state of \\'Filters\\' allows date navigation or to try to revert to the previous menu state to access the \\'Today\\' option again.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[508,87],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Filters\\' option in the side menu (text \\'Filters\\' at approx [508, 87]). The \\'Filters\\' section is currently expanded (arrow pointing down). This tap is intended to collapse the \\'Filters\\' section, which should change the arrow to point up and potentially reveal the \\'Today\\' option with the calendar icon again, or other date navigation options. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Filters\\' at [508, 87] successfully collapsed the \\'Filters\\' section in the side menu. The arrow next to \\'Filters\\' now points upwards. As a result, the \\'Today\\' option, accompanied by a calendar icon, has become visible again in the menu. This brings the agent closer to achieving the subgoal of navigating to the specific date, as the \\'Today\\' option is a prime candidate for initiating date selection.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
