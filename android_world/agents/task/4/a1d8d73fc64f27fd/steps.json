Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 712, 65, 797], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 84, 148, 345], \\'text\\': \\'Sun; Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 336, 722, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Gmail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 561, 722, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [704, 781, 722, 921], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [775, 295, 872, 712], \\'text\\': \\'0 @\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 72, 855, 233]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 298, 857, 466]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 535, 858, 706]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 536, 729, 695]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 764, 857, 930]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 764, 728, 928]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 299, 730, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 701, 947, 795]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [893, 801, 952, 922]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 823, 39, 899]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the list of all installed applications, where I can then find and tap the OsmAnd app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the OsmAnd app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top of the screen (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal more apps in the list, hopefully including the OsmAnd app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards, revealing more applications. The \\'OsmAnd\\' application icon is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the OsmAnd app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 2: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the list of all installed applications, where I can then find and tap the OsmAnd app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the OsmAnd app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top of the screen (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal more apps in the list, hopefully including the OsmAnd app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards, revealing more applications. The \\'OsmAnd\\' application icon is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the OsmAnd app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[518,612],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located in the third column, third row. This action is predicted to open the OsmAnd application, which will allow me to proceed with the next subgoals of planning and saving a track. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon was successful. The OsmAnd application launched, and its main map interface is now displayed. This completes the first subgoal of opening the app and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The next step is to find and activate the route planning functionality within the app.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the list of all installed applications, where I can then find and tap the OsmAnd app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the OsmAnd app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top of the screen (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal more apps in the list, hopefully including the OsmAnd app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards, revealing more applications. The \\'OsmAnd\\' application icon is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the OsmAnd app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[518,612],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located in the third column, third row. This action is predicted to open the OsmAnd application, which will allow me to proceed with the next subgoals of planning and saving a track. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon was successful. The OsmAnd application launched, and its main map interface is now displayed. This completes the first subgoal of opening the app and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The next step is to find and activate the route planning functionality within the app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the list of all installed applications, where I can then find and tap the OsmAnd app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the OsmAnd app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top of the screen (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal more apps in the list, hopefully including the OsmAnd app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards, revealing more applications. The \\'OsmAnd\\' application icon is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the OsmAnd app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[518,612],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located in the third column, third row. This action is predicted to open the OsmAnd application, which will allow me to proceed with the next subgoals of planning and saving a track. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon was successful. The OsmAnd application launched, and its main map interface is now displayed. This completes the first subgoal of opening the app and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The next step is to find and activate the route planning functionality within the app.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[935,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located in the bottom left corner of the screen. This icon is represented by three horizontal lines. This action is predicted to open a menu where I can find an option to plan a route. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the hamburger menu icon at [935, 80] was successful. It opened a side menu on the left side of the screen. This menu contains a list of options, including \\'Plan a route\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of initiating route planning.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the list of all installed applications, where I can then find and tap the OsmAnd app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the OsmAnd app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top of the screen (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal more apps in the list, hopefully including the OsmAnd app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards, revealing more applications. The \\'OsmAnd\\' application icon is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the OsmAnd app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[518,612],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located in the third column, third row. This action is predicted to open the OsmAnd application, which will allow me to proceed with the next subgoals of planning and saving a track. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon was successful. The OsmAnd application launched, and its main map interface is now displayed. This completes the first subgoal of opening the app and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The next step is to find and activate the route planning functionality within the app.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[935,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located in the bottom left corner of the screen. This icon is represented by three horizontal lines. This action is predicted to open a menu where I can find an option to plan a route. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the hamburger menu icon at [935, 80] was successful. It opened a side menu on the left side of the screen. This menu contains a list of options, including \\'Plan a route\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of initiating route planning.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[589,260],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Plan a route\\' option in the side menu. The \\'Plan a route\\' option is currently visible. This action is predicted to open the route planning interface, where waypoints can be added. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open OsmAnd app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The OsmAnd app\\'s main screen is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled down, and tapped on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the list of all installed applications, where I can then find and tap the OsmAnd app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the OsmAnd app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top of the screen (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal more apps in the list, hopefully including the OsmAnd app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards, revealing more applications. The \\'OsmAnd\\' application icon is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the OsmAnd app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[518,612],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located in the third column, third row. This action is predicted to open the OsmAnd application, which will allow me to proceed with the next subgoals of planning and saving a track. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon was successful. The OsmAnd application launched, and its main map interface is now displayed. This completes the first subgoal of opening the app and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The next step is to find and activate the route planning functionality within the app.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[935,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located in the bottom left corner of the screen. This icon is represented by three horizontal lines. This action is predicted to open a menu where I can find an option to plan a route. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the hamburger menu icon at [935, 80] was successful. It opened a side menu on the left side of the screen. This menu contains a list of options, including \\'Plan a route\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of initiating route planning.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[589,260],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Plan a route\\' option in the side menu. The \\'Plan a route\\' option is currently visible. This action is predicted to open the route planning interface, where waypoints can be added. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Plan a route\\' was successful. A new screen appeared at the bottom, offering options to \\'Create new route\\', \\'Open existing track\\', or \\'Import track\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of initiating route planning. The next step is to tap \\'Create new route\\' to proceed to the waypoint addition interface.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the list of all installed applications, where I can then find and tap the OsmAnd app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the OsmAnd app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[100,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (around [900, 500]) towards the top of the screen (around [100, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal more apps in the list, hopefully including the OsmAnd app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards, revealing more applications. The \\'OsmAnd\\' application icon is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the OsmAnd app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[518,612],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located in the third column, third row. This action is predicted to open the OsmAnd application, which will allow me to proceed with the next subgoals of planning and saving a track. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon was successful. The OsmAnd application launched, and its main map interface is now displayed. This completes the first subgoal of opening the app and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The next step is to find and activate the route planning functionality within the app.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[935,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located in the bottom left corner of the screen. This icon is represented by three horizontal lines. This action is predicted to open a menu where I can find an option to plan a route. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the hamburger menu icon at [935, 80] was successful. It opened a side menu on the left side of the screen. This menu contains a list of options, including \\'Plan a route\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of initiating route planning.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[589,260],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Plan a route\\' option in the side menu. The \\'Plan a route\\' option is currently visible. This action is predicted to open the route planning interface, where waypoints can be added. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Plan a route\\' was successful. A new screen appeared at the bottom, offering options to \\'Create new route\\', \\'Open existing track\\', or \\'Import track\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of initiating route planning. The next step is to tap \\'Create new route\\' to proceed to the waypoint addition interface.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[719,321],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Create new route\\' option. This option is currently visible on the screen. This action is predicted to open the interface for adding waypoints to a new route. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open OsmAnd app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The OsmAnd app\\'s main screen is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled down, and tapped on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal more apps in the list, hopefully including the OsmAnd app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards, revealing more applications. The \\'OsmAnd\\' application icon is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the OsmAnd app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[518,612],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located in the third column, third row. This action is predicted to open the OsmAnd application, which will allow me to proceed with the next subgoals of planning and saving a track. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon was successful. The OsmAnd application launched, and its main map interface is now displayed. This completes the first subgoal of opening the app and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The next step is to find and activate the route planning functionality within the app.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[935,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located in the bottom left corner of the screen. This icon is represented by three horizontal lines. This action is predicted to open a menu where I can find an option to plan a route. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the hamburger menu icon at [935, 80] was successful. It opened a side menu on the left side of the screen. This menu contains a list of options, including \\'Plan a route\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of initiating route planning.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[589,260],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Plan a route\\' option in the side menu. The \\'Plan a route\\' option is currently visible. This action is predicted to open the route planning interface, where waypoints can be added. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Plan a route\\' was successful. A new screen appeared at the bottom, offering options to \\'Create new route\\', \\'Open existing track\\', or \\'Import track\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of initiating route planning. The next step is to tap \\'Create new route\\' to proceed to the waypoint addition interface.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[719,321],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Create new route\\' option. This option is currently visible on the screen. This action is predicted to open the interface for adding waypoints to a new route. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Create new route\\' was successful. The application transitioned to the route planning interface, where waypoints can be added. This is indicated by the map view and the presence of \\'Points\\', \\'Graph\\', \\'Options\\', and \\'Add\\' buttons. This action completed the active subgoal of initiating route planning.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal more apps in the list, hopefully including the OsmAnd app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards, revealing more applications. The \\'OsmAnd\\' application icon is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the OsmAnd app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[518,612],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located in the third column, third row. This action is predicted to open the OsmAnd application, which will allow me to proceed with the next subgoals of planning and saving a track. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon was successful. The OsmAnd application launched, and its main map interface is now displayed. This completes the first subgoal of opening the app and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The next step is to find and activate the route planning functionality within the app.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[935,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located in the bottom left corner of the screen. This icon is represented by three horizontal lines. This action is predicted to open a menu where I can find an option to plan a route. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the hamburger menu icon at [935, 80] was successful. It opened a side menu on the left side of the screen. This menu contains a list of options, including \\'Plan a route\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of initiating route planning.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[589,260],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Plan a route\\' option in the side menu. The \\'Plan a route\\' option is currently visible. This action is predicted to open the route planning interface, where waypoints can be added. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Plan a route\\' was successful. A new screen appeared at the bottom, offering options to \\'Create new route\\', \\'Open existing track\\', or \\'Import track\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of initiating route planning. The next step is to tap \\'Create new route\\' to proceed to the waypoint addition interface.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[719,321],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Create new route\\' option. This option is currently visible on the screen. This action is predicted to open the interface for adding waypoints to a new route. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Create new route\\' was successful. The application transitioned to the route planning interface, where waypoints can be added. This is indicated by the map view and the presence of \\'Points\\', \\'Graph\\', \\'Options\\', and \\'Add\\' buttons. This action completed the active subgoal of initiating route planning.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,862],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button located at the bottom right of the screen. The \\'Add\\' button is currently visible. This action is predicted to open an interface where I can search for and add the first waypoint, \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

However, the action resulted in adding a waypoint at the current center of the map, as evidenced by the point counter changing from 0 to 1 and a new marker appearing on the map. This indicates that the 'Add' button in this context directly adds the map center as a waypoint, rather than initiating a search. The active Subgoal (ID 3: Add 'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein' as the first waypoint) was not progressed as intended. To achieve the subgoal, we need to find a way to search for a specific location. The next planned step is to tap the 'Points' button. This button might lead to a list of current waypoints and offer options to add new waypoints via search, or edit/delete existing ones.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[518,612],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located in the third column, third row. This action is predicted to open the OsmAnd application, which will allow me to proceed with the next subgoals of planning and saving a track. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon was successful. The OsmAnd application launched, and its main map interface is now displayed. This completes the first subgoal of opening the app and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The next step is to find and activate the route planning functionality within the app.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[935,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located in the bottom left corner of the screen. This icon is represented by three horizontal lines. This action is predicted to open a menu where I can find an option to plan a route. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the hamburger menu icon at [935, 80] was successful. It opened a side menu on the left side of the screen. This menu contains a list of options, including \\'Plan a route\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of initiating route planning.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[589,260],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Plan a route\\' option in the side menu. The \\'Plan a route\\' option is currently visible. This action is predicted to open the route planning interface, where waypoints can be added. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Plan a route\\' was successful. A new screen appeared at the bottom, offering options to \\'Create new route\\', \\'Open existing track\\', or \\'Import track\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of initiating route planning. The next step is to tap \\'Create new route\\' to proceed to the waypoint addition interface.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[719,321],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Create new route\\' option. This option is currently visible on the screen. This action is predicted to open the interface for adding waypoints to a new route. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Create new route\\' was successful. The application transitioned to the route planning interface, where waypoints can be added. This is indicated by the map view and the presence of \\'Points\\', \\'Graph\\', \\'Options\\', and \\'Add\\' buttons. This action completed the active subgoal of initiating route planning.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,862],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button located at the bottom right of the screen. The \\'Add\\' button is currently visible. This action is predicted to open an interface where I can search for and add the first waypoint, \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 862] was executed. Instead of opening a search interface for waypoints, it added a waypoint at the current center of the map. This is confirmed by the text changing from \"0 ft, points: 0\" to \"0 ft, points: 1\" and a new marker appearing on the map. This action did not bring the agent closer to adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint, as it added an arbitrary point. To correct this, we need to find the correct way to search for and add specific waypoints. The next step will be to tap the \"Points\" button to see if it offers search functionality or waypoint management.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[518,612],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon, which is currently visible in the app drawer. The icon is located in the third column, third row. This action is predicted to open the OsmAnd application, which will allow me to proceed with the next subgoals of planning and saving a track. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon was successful. The OsmAnd application launched, and its main map interface is now displayed. This completes the first subgoal of opening the app and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The next step is to find and activate the route planning functionality within the app.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[935,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located in the bottom left corner of the screen. This icon is represented by three horizontal lines. This action is predicted to open a menu where I can find an option to plan a route. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the hamburger menu icon at [935, 80] was successful. It opened a side menu on the left side of the screen. This menu contains a list of options, including \\'Plan a route\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of initiating route planning.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[589,260],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Plan a route\\' option in the side menu. The \\'Plan a route\\' option is currently visible. This action is predicted to open the route planning interface, where waypoints can be added. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Plan a route\\' was successful. A new screen appeared at the bottom, offering options to \\'Create new route\\', \\'Open existing track\\', or \\'Import track\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of initiating route planning. The next step is to tap \\'Create new route\\' to proceed to the waypoint addition interface.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[719,321],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Create new route\\' option. This option is currently visible on the screen. This action is predicted to open the interface for adding waypoints to a new route. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Create new route\\' was successful. The application transitioned to the route planning interface, where waypoints can be added. This is indicated by the map view and the presence of \\'Points\\', \\'Graph\\', \\'Options\\', and \\'Add\\' buttons. This action completed the active subgoal of initiating route planning.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,862],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button located at the bottom right of the screen. The \\'Add\\' button is currently visible. This action is predicted to open an interface where I can search for and add the first waypoint, \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 862] was executed. Instead of opening a search interface for waypoints, it added a waypoint at the current center of the map. This is confirmed by the text changing from \"0 ft, points: 0\" to \"0 ft, points: 1\" and a new marker appearing on the map. This action did not bring the agent closer to adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint, as it added an arbitrary point. To correct this, we need to find the correct way to search for and add specific waypoints. The next step will be to tap the \"Points\" button to see if it offers search functionality or waypoint management.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[882,269],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Points\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Graph\\' button. The \\'Points\\' button is currently visible. This action is predicted to open an interface for managing the waypoints of the current route, hopefully allowing me to search for and add \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open OsmAnd app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The OsmAnd app\\'s main screen is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled down, and tapped on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[935,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located in the bottom left corner of the screen. This icon is represented by three horizontal lines. This action is predicted to open a menu where I can find an option to plan a route. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the hamburger menu icon at [935, 80] was successful. It opened a side menu on the left side of the screen. This menu contains a list of options, including \\'Plan a route\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of initiating route planning.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[589,260],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Plan a route\\' option in the side menu. The \\'Plan a route\\' option is currently visible. This action is predicted to open the route planning interface, where waypoints can be added. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Plan a route\\' was successful. A new screen appeared at the bottom, offering options to \\'Create new route\\', \\'Open existing track\\', or \\'Import track\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of initiating route planning. The next step is to tap \\'Create new route\\' to proceed to the waypoint addition interface.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[719,321],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Create new route\\' option. This option is currently visible on the screen. This action is predicted to open the interface for adding waypoints to a new route. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Create new route\\' was successful. The application transitioned to the route planning interface, where waypoints can be added. This is indicated by the map view and the presence of \\'Points\\', \\'Graph\\', \\'Options\\', and \\'Add\\' buttons. This action completed the active subgoal of initiating route planning.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,862],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button located at the bottom right of the screen. The \\'Add\\' button is currently visible. This action is predicted to open an interface where I can search for and add the first waypoint, \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 862] was executed. Instead of opening a search interface for waypoints, it added a waypoint at the current center of the map. This is confirmed by the text changing from \"0 ft, points: 0\" to \"0 ft, points: 1\" and a new marker appearing on the map. This action did not bring the agent closer to adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint, as it added an arbitrary point. To correct this, we need to find the correct way to search for and add specific waypoints. The next step will be to tap the \"Points\" button to see if it offers search functionality or waypoint management.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[882,269],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Points\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Graph\\' button. The \\'Points\\' button is currently visible. This action is predicted to open an interface for managing the waypoints of the current route, hopefully allowing me to search for and add \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Points\\' button (intended coordinates around [882, 269], actual tap was on the \\'Points\\' tab) was successful. It revealed a list of the current waypoints below the \\'Points\\' and \\'Graph\\' tabs. The list currently shows \"Point - 1 Start\", which was the point added erroneously in a previous step. This action helps in understanding how waypoints are listed and potentially managed, but it did not directly provide a search functionality to add \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. The next step should be to tap the search icon visible on the map screen to find and add the desired waypoint.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"Type to search all\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nSave a track with waypoints Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein, Triesen, Liechtenstein, Bendern, Liechtenstein in the OsmAnd maps app in the same order as listed.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[935,80],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located in the bottom left corner of the screen. This icon is represented by three horizontal lines. This action is predicted to open a menu where I can find an option to plan a route. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the hamburger menu icon at [935, 80] was successful. It opened a side menu on the left side of the screen. This menu contains a list of options, including \\'Plan a route\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of initiating route planning.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[589,260],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Plan a route\\' option in the side menu. The \\'Plan a route\\' option is currently visible. This action is predicted to open the route planning interface, where waypoints can be added. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Plan a route\\' was successful. A new screen appeared at the bottom, offering options to \\'Create new route\\', \\'Open existing track\\', or \\'Import track\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of initiating route planning. The next step is to tap \\'Create new route\\' to proceed to the waypoint addition interface.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[719,321],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Create new route\\' option. This option is currently visible on the screen. This action is predicted to open the interface for adding waypoints to a new route. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Create new route\\' was successful. The application transitioned to the route planning interface, where waypoints can be added. This is indicated by the map view and the presence of \\'Points\\', \\'Graph\\', \\'Options\\', and \\'Add\\' buttons. This action completed the active subgoal of initiating route planning.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,862],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button located at the bottom right of the screen. The \\'Add\\' button is currently visible. This action is predicted to open an interface where I can search for and add the first waypoint, \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 862] was executed. Instead of opening a search interface for waypoints, it added a waypoint at the current center of the map. This is confirmed by the text changing from \"0 ft, points: 0\" to \"0 ft, points: 1\" and a new marker appearing on the map. This action did not bring the agent closer to adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint, as it added an arbitrary point. To correct this, we need to find the correct way to search for and add specific waypoints. The next step will be to tap the \"Points\" button to see if it offers search functionality or waypoint management.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[882,269],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Points\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Graph\\' button. The \\'Points\\' button is currently visible. This action is predicted to open an interface for managing the waypoints of the current route, hopefully allowing me to search for and add \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Points\\' button (intended coordinates around [882, 269], actual tap was on the \\'Points\\' tab) was successful. It revealed a list of the current waypoints below the \\'Points\\' and \\'Graph\\' tabs. The list currently shows \"Point - 1 Start\", which was the point added erroneously in a previous step. This action helps in understanding how waypoints are listed and potentially managed, but it did not directly provide a search functionality to add \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. The next step should be to tap the search icon visible on the map screen to find and add the desired waypoint.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located to the right of the \\'Plan a route\\' text at the top left of the screen. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface where I can input \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open OsmAnd app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The OsmAnd app\\'s main screen is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled down, and tapped on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[589,260],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Plan a route\\' option in the side menu. The \\'Plan a route\\' option is currently visible. This action is predicted to open the route planning interface, where waypoints can be added. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Plan a route\\' was successful. A new screen appeared at the bottom, offering options to \\'Create new route\\', \\'Open existing track\\', or \\'Import track\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of initiating route planning. The next step is to tap \\'Create new route\\' to proceed to the waypoint addition interface.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[719,321],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Create new route\\' option. This option is currently visible on the screen. This action is predicted to open the interface for adding waypoints to a new route. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Create new route\\' was successful. The application transitioned to the route planning interface, where waypoints can be added. This is indicated by the map view and the presence of \\'Points\\', \\'Graph\\', \\'Options\\', and \\'Add\\' buttons. This action completed the active subgoal of initiating route planning.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,862],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button located at the bottom right of the screen. The \\'Add\\' button is currently visible. This action is predicted to open an interface where I can search for and add the first waypoint, \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 862] was executed. Instead of opening a search interface for waypoints, it added a waypoint at the current center of the map. This is confirmed by the text changing from \"0 ft, points: 0\" to \"0 ft, points: 1\" and a new marker appearing on the map. This action did not bring the agent closer to adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint, as it added an arbitrary point. To correct this, we need to find the correct way to search for and add specific waypoints. The next step will be to tap the \"Points\" button to see if it offers search functionality or waypoint management.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[882,269],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Points\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Graph\\' button. The \\'Points\\' button is currently visible. This action is predicted to open an interface for managing the waypoints of the current route, hopefully allowing me to search for and add \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Points\\' button (intended coordinates around [882, 269], actual tap was on the \\'Points\\' tab) was successful. It revealed a list of the current waypoints below the \\'Points\\' and \\'Graph\\' tabs. The list currently shows \"Point - 1 Start\", which was the point added erroneously in a previous step. This action helps in understanding how waypoints are listed and potentially managed, but it did not directly provide a search functionality to add \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. The next step should be to tap the search icon visible on the map screen to find and add the desired waypoint.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located to the right of the \\'Plan a route\\' text at the top left of the screen. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface where I can input \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon at [145, 170] was successful. It opened a search interface. The text field \\'Type to search all\\' is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible, ready for text input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 170, 100, 519], \\'text\\': \\'Type to search all\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 87, 151, 250], \\'text\\': \\'HISTORY\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 385, 150, 619], \\'text\\': \\'CATEGORIES\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 748, 150, 921], \\'text\\': \\'ADDRESS\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [115, 1, 170, 333]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [115, 333, 169, 680]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [115, 682, 169, 995]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 42, 41, 244]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"Type to search all\", resource-id=\"net.osmand:id/searchEditText\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.osmand\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[189,128][1080,275]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Type to search all\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[589,260],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Plan a route\\' option in the side menu. The \\'Plan a route\\' option is currently visible. This action is predicted to open the route planning interface, where waypoints can be added. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Plan a route\\' was successful. A new screen appeared at the bottom, offering options to \\'Create new route\\', \\'Open existing track\\', or \\'Import track\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of initiating route planning. The next step is to tap \\'Create new route\\' to proceed to the waypoint addition interface.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[719,321],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Create new route\\' option. This option is currently visible on the screen. This action is predicted to open the interface for adding waypoints to a new route. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Create new route\\' was successful. The application transitioned to the route planning interface, where waypoints can be added. This is indicated by the map view and the presence of \\'Points\\', \\'Graph\\', \\'Options\\', and \\'Add\\' buttons. This action completed the active subgoal of initiating route planning.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,862],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button located at the bottom right of the screen. The \\'Add\\' button is currently visible. This action is predicted to open an interface where I can search for and add the first waypoint, \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 862] was executed. Instead of opening a search interface for waypoints, it added a waypoint at the current center of the map. This is confirmed by the text changing from \"0 ft, points: 0\" to \"0 ft, points: 1\" and a new marker appearing on the map. This action did not bring the agent closer to adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint, as it added an arbitrary point. To correct this, we need to find the correct way to search for and add specific waypoints. The next step will be to tap the \"Points\" button to see if it offers search functionality or waypoint management.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[882,269],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Points\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Graph\\' button. The \\'Points\\' button is currently visible. This action is predicted to open an interface for managing the waypoints of the current route, hopefully allowing me to search for and add \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Points\\' button (intended coordinates around [882, 269], actual tap was on the \\'Points\\' tab) was successful. It revealed a list of the current waypoints below the \\'Points\\' and \\'Graph\\' tabs. The list currently shows \"Point - 1 Start\", which was the point added erroneously in a previous step. This action helps in understanding how waypoints are listed and potentially managed, but it did not directly provide a search functionality to add \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. The next step should be to tap the search icon visible on the map screen to find and add the desired waypoint.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located to the right of the \\'Plan a route\\' text at the top left of the screen. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface where I can input \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon at [145, 170] was successful. It opened a search interface. The text field \\'Type to search all\\' is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible, ready for text input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\\' into the focused search field \\'Type to search all\\'. The text field is currently focused and has placeholder text. This action is predicted to replace the placeholder text with \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' and then initiate a search for this location because of the trailing newline character. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open OsmAnd app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The OsmAnd app\\'s main screen is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled down, and tapped on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Points\\' button (intended coordinates around [882, 269], actual tap was on the \\'Points\\' tab) was successful. It revealed a list of the current waypoints below the \\'Points\\' and \\'Graph\\' tabs. The list currently shows \"Point - 1 Start\", which was the point added erroneously in a previous step. This action helps in understanding how waypoints are listed and potentially managed, but it did not directly provide a search functionality to add \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. The next step should be to tap the search icon visible on the map screen to find and add the desired waypoint.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located to the right of the \\'Plan a route\\' text at the top left of the screen. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface where I can input \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon at [145, 170] was successful. It opened a search interface. The text field \\'Type to search all\\' is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible, ready for text input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\\' into the focused search field \\'Type to search all\\'. The text field is currently focused and has placeholder text. This action is predicted to replace the placeholder text with \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' and then initiate a search for this location because of the trailing newline character. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\\' was successful. The text was entered into the search field, and the search was initiated. The screen now displays search results, with \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' in the search bar and options like \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' and \\'Liechtenstein Country\\' below it. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 167, 100, 668], \\'text\\': \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [133, 126, 151, 371], \\'text\\': \\'SHOW ON MAP\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [202, 130, 244, 370], \\'text\\': \\'Liechtenstein Country\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [203, 851, 217, 965], \\'text\\': \\'3296 mi\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [274, 314, 288, 689], \\'text\\': \\'INCREASE SEARCH RADIUS\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 39, 41, 246]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 909, 100, 977]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"2\", text=\"\", resource-id=\"net.osmand:id/buttonToolbar\", class=\"android.widget.LinearLayout\", package=\"net.osmand\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"false\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[0,278][1080,404]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nSave a track with waypoints Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein, Triesen, Liechtenstein, Bendern, Liechtenstein in the OsmAnd maps app in the same order as listed.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[719,321],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Create new route\\' option. This option is currently visible on the screen. This action is predicted to open the interface for adding waypoints to a new route. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Create new route\\' was successful. The application transitioned to the route planning interface, where waypoints can be added. This is indicated by the map view and the presence of \\'Points\\', \\'Graph\\', \\'Options\\', and \\'Add\\' buttons. This action completed the active subgoal of initiating route planning.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,862],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button located at the bottom right of the screen. The \\'Add\\' button is currently visible. This action is predicted to open an interface where I can search for and add the first waypoint, \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 862] was executed. Instead of opening a search interface for waypoints, it added a waypoint at the current center of the map. This is confirmed by the text changing from \"0 ft, points: 0\" to \"0 ft, points: 1\" and a new marker appearing on the map. This action did not bring the agent closer to adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint, as it added an arbitrary point. To correct this, we need to find the correct way to search for and add specific waypoints. The next step will be to tap the \"Points\" button to see if it offers search functionality or waypoint management.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[882,269],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Points\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Graph\\' button. The \\'Points\\' button is currently visible. This action is predicted to open an interface for managing the waypoints of the current route, hopefully allowing me to search for and add \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Points\\' button (intended coordinates around [882, 269], actual tap was on the \\'Points\\' tab) was successful. It revealed a list of the current waypoints below the \\'Points\\' and \\'Graph\\' tabs. The list currently shows \"Point - 1 Start\", which was the point added erroneously in a previous step. This action helps in understanding how waypoints are listed and potentially managed, but it did not directly provide a search functionality to add \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. The next step should be to tap the search icon visible on the map screen to find and add the desired waypoint.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located to the right of the \\'Plan a route\\' text at the top left of the screen. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface where I can input \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon at [145, 170] was successful. It opened a search interface. The text field \\'Type to search all\\' is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible, ready for text input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\\' into the focused search field \\'Type to search all\\'. The text field is currently focused and has placeholder text. This action is predicted to replace the placeholder text with \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' and then initiate a search for this location because of the trailing newline character. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\\' was successful. The text was entered into the search field, and the search was initiated. The screen now displays search results, with \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' in the search bar and options like \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' and \\'Liechtenstein Country\\' below it. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is associated with the search result \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. This button is currently visible on the screen. This action is predicted to select \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' and potentially show it on the map, which is a step towards adding it as the first waypoint. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open OsmAnd app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The OsmAnd app\\'s main screen is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled down, and tapped on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,862],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button located at the bottom right of the screen. The \\'Add\\' button is currently visible. This action is predicted to open an interface where I can search for and add the first waypoint, \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 862] was executed. Instead of opening a search interface for waypoints, it added a waypoint at the current center of the map. This is confirmed by the text changing from \"0 ft, points: 0\" to \"0 ft, points: 1\" and a new marker appearing on the map. This action did not bring the agent closer to adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint, as it added an arbitrary point. To correct this, we need to find the correct way to search for and add specific waypoints. The next step will be to tap the \"Points\" button to see if it offers search functionality or waypoint management.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[882,269],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Points\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Graph\\' button. The \\'Points\\' button is currently visible. This action is predicted to open an interface for managing the waypoints of the current route, hopefully allowing me to search for and add \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Points\\' button (intended coordinates around [882, 269], actual tap was on the \\'Points\\' tab) was successful. It revealed a list of the current waypoints below the \\'Points\\' and \\'Graph\\' tabs. The list currently shows \"Point - 1 Start\", which was the point added erroneously in a previous step. This action helps in understanding how waypoints are listed and potentially managed, but it did not directly provide a search functionality to add \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. The next step should be to tap the search icon visible on the map screen to find and add the desired waypoint.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located to the right of the \\'Plan a route\\' text at the top left of the screen. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface where I can input \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon at [145, 170] was successful. It opened a search interface. The text field \\'Type to search all\\' is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible, ready for text input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\\' into the focused search field \\'Type to search all\\'. The text field is currently focused and has placeholder text. This action is predicted to replace the placeholder text with \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' and then initiate a search for this location because of the trailing newline character. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\\' was successful. The text was entered into the search field, and the search was initiated. The screen now displays search results, with \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' in the search bar and options like \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' and \\'Liechtenstein Country\\' below it. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is associated with the search result \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. This button is currently visible on the screen. This action is predicted to select \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' and potentially show it on the map, which is a step towards adding it as the first waypoint. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button for \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' was successful. The application transitioned from the search results screen to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\', and this location is indicated by the title at the top of the screen. The bottom panel shows \"Point - 1 Start\" and \"0 ft, points: 1\", which implies that \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' has been set as the first waypoint. This action successfully completed the active subgoal of adding the first waypoint. The UI is now ready for adding subsequent waypoints.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,862],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button located at the bottom right of the screen. The \\'Add\\' button is currently visible. This action is predicted to open an interface where I can search for and add the first waypoint, \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 862] was executed. Instead of opening a search interface for waypoints, it added a waypoint at the current center of the map. This is confirmed by the text changing from \"0 ft, points: 0\" to \"0 ft, points: 1\" and a new marker appearing on the map. This action did not bring the agent closer to adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint, as it added an arbitrary point. To correct this, we need to find the correct way to search for and add specific waypoints. The next step will be to tap the \"Points\" button to see if it offers search functionality or waypoint management.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[882,269],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Points\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Graph\\' button. The \\'Points\\' button is currently visible. This action is predicted to open an interface for managing the waypoints of the current route, hopefully allowing me to search for and add \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Points\\' button (intended coordinates around [882, 269], actual tap was on the \\'Points\\' tab) was successful. It revealed a list of the current waypoints below the \\'Points\\' and \\'Graph\\' tabs. The list currently shows \"Point - 1 Start\", which was the point added erroneously in a previous step. This action helps in understanding how waypoints are listed and potentially managed, but it did not directly provide a search functionality to add \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. The next step should be to tap the search icon visible on the map screen to find and add the desired waypoint.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located to the right of the \\'Plan a route\\' text at the top left of the screen. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface where I can input \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon at [145, 170] was successful. It opened a search interface. The text field \\'Type to search all\\' is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible, ready for text input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\\' into the focused search field \\'Type to search all\\'. The text field is currently focused and has placeholder text. This action is predicted to replace the placeholder text with \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' and then initiate a search for this location because of the trailing newline character. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\\' was successful. The text was entered into the search field, and the search was initiated. The screen now displays search results, with \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' in the search bar and options like \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' and \\'Liechtenstein Country\\' below it. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is associated with the search result \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. This button is currently visible on the screen. This action is predicted to select \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' and potentially show it on the map, which is a step towards adding it as the first waypoint. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button for \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' was successful. The application transitioned from the search results screen to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\', and this location is indicated by the title at the top of the screen. The bottom panel shows \"Point - 1 Start\" and \"0 ft, points: 1\", which implies that \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' has been set as the first waypoint. This action successfully completed the active subgoal of adding the first waypoint. The UI is now ready for adding subsequent waypoints.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,864],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, which is located at the bottom right of the screen (center of the icon with bounding box [925, 745, 966, 983]). This action is predicted to add a new waypoint to the current route. The \\'points: 1\\' indicator should change to \\'points: 2\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open OsmAnd app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The OsmAnd app\\'s main screen is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled down, and tapped on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[882,269],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Points\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Graph\\' button. The \\'Points\\' button is currently visible. This action is predicted to open an interface for managing the waypoints of the current route, hopefully allowing me to search for and add \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Points\\' button (intended coordinates around [882, 269], actual tap was on the \\'Points\\' tab) was successful. It revealed a list of the current waypoints below the \\'Points\\' and \\'Graph\\' tabs. The list currently shows \"Point - 1 Start\", which was the point added erroneously in a previous step. This action helps in understanding how waypoints are listed and potentially managed, but it did not directly provide a search functionality to add \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. The next step should be to tap the search icon visible on the map screen to find and add the desired waypoint.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located to the right of the \\'Plan a route\\' text at the top left of the screen. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface where I can input \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon at [145, 170] was successful. It opened a search interface. The text field \\'Type to search all\\' is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible, ready for text input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\\' into the focused search field \\'Type to search all\\'. The text field is currently focused and has placeholder text. This action is predicted to replace the placeholder text with \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' and then initiate a search for this location because of the trailing newline character. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\\' was successful. The text was entered into the search field, and the search was initiated. The screen now displays search results, with \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' in the search bar and options like \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' and \\'Liechtenstein Country\\' below it. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is associated with the search result \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. This button is currently visible on the screen. This action is predicted to select \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' and potentially show it on the map, which is a step towards adding it as the first waypoint. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button for \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' was successful. The application transitioned from the search results screen to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\', and this location is indicated by the title at the top of the screen. The bottom panel shows \"Point - 1 Start\" and \"0 ft, points: 1\", which implies that \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' has been set as the first waypoint. This action successfully completed the active subgoal of adding the first waypoint. The UI is now ready for adding subsequent waypoints.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,864],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, which is located at the bottom right of the screen (center of the icon with bounding box [925, 745, 966, 983]). This action is predicted to add a new waypoint to the current route. The \\'points: 1\\' indicator should change to \\'points: 2\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 864] did not add a new waypoint to the route. The primary change observed is that the title at the top of the screen changed from \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' to \\'Plan a route\\'. The number of waypoints displayed in the bottom panel remained \\'1\\' (\\'0 ft, points: 1\\'). This action did not directly advance the goal of adding the second waypoint, but it returned the UI to a state where route planning actions, like searching for waypoints, can be initiated. The next step should be to use the search functionality.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[882,269],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Points\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Graph\\' button. The \\'Points\\' button is currently visible. This action is predicted to open an interface for managing the waypoints of the current route, hopefully allowing me to search for and add \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Points\\' button (intended coordinates around [882, 269], actual tap was on the \\'Points\\' tab) was successful. It revealed a list of the current waypoints below the \\'Points\\' and \\'Graph\\' tabs. The list currently shows \"Point - 1 Start\", which was the point added erroneously in a previous step. This action helps in understanding how waypoints are listed and potentially managed, but it did not directly provide a search functionality to add \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. The next step should be to tap the search icon visible on the map screen to find and add the desired waypoint.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located to the right of the \\'Plan a route\\' text at the top left of the screen. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface where I can input \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon at [145, 170] was successful. It opened a search interface. The text field \\'Type to search all\\' is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible, ready for text input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\\' into the focused search field \\'Type to search all\\'. The text field is currently focused and has placeholder text. This action is predicted to replace the placeholder text with \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' and then initiate a search for this location because of the trailing newline character. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\\' was successful. The text was entered into the search field, and the search was initiated. The screen now displays search results, with \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' in the search bar and options like \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' and \\'Liechtenstein Country\\' below it. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is associated with the search result \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. This button is currently visible on the screen. This action is predicted to select \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' and potentially show it on the map, which is a step towards adding it as the first waypoint. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button for \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' was successful. The application transitioned from the search results screen to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\', and this location is indicated by the title at the top of the screen. The bottom panel shows \"Point - 1 Start\" and \"0 ft, points: 1\", which implies that \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' has been set as the first waypoint. This action successfully completed the active subgoal of adding the first waypoint. The UI is now ready for adding subsequent waypoints.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,864],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, which is located at the bottom right of the screen (center of the icon with bounding box [925, 745, 966, 983]). This action is predicted to add a new waypoint to the current route. The \\'points: 1\\' indicator should change to \\'points: 2\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 864] did not add a new waypoint to the route. The primary change observed is that the title at the top of the screen changed from \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' to \\'Plan a route\\'. The number of waypoints displayed in the bottom panel remained \\'1\\' (\\'0 ft, points: 1\\'). This action did not directly advance the goal of adding the second waypoint, but it returned the UI to a state where route planning actions, like searching for waypoints, can be initiated. The next step should be to use the search functionality.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located near the top left of the screen, to the right of the \\'Plan a route\\' text. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface where I can input \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open OsmAnd app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The OsmAnd app\\'s main screen is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled down, and tapped on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located to the right of the \\'Plan a route\\' text at the top left of the screen. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface where I can input \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon at [145, 170] was successful. It opened a search interface. The text field \\'Type to search all\\' is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible, ready for text input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\\' into the focused search field \\'Type to search all\\'. The text field is currently focused and has placeholder text. This action is predicted to replace the placeholder text with \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' and then initiate a search for this location because of the trailing newline character. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\\' was successful. The text was entered into the search field, and the search was initiated. The screen now displays search results, with \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' in the search bar and options like \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' and \\'Liechtenstein Country\\' below it. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is associated with the search result \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. This button is currently visible on the screen. This action is predicted to select \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' and potentially show it on the map, which is a step towards adding it as the first waypoint. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button for \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' was successful. The application transitioned from the search results screen to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\', and this location is indicated by the title at the top of the screen. The bottom panel shows \"Point - 1 Start\" and \"0 ft, points: 1\", which implies that \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' has been set as the first waypoint. This action successfully completed the active subgoal of adding the first waypoint. The UI is now ready for adding subsequent waypoints.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,864],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, which is located at the bottom right of the screen (center of the icon with bounding box [925, 745, 966, 983]). This action is predicted to add a new waypoint to the current route. The \\'points: 1\\' indicator should change to \\'points: 2\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 864] did not add a new waypoint to the route. The primary change observed is that the title at the top of the screen changed from \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' to \\'Plan a route\\'. The number of waypoints displayed in the bottom panel remained \\'1\\' (\\'0 ft, points: 1\\'). This action did not directly advance the goal of adding the second waypoint, but it returned the UI to a state where route planning actions, like searching for waypoints, can be initiated. The next step should be to use the search functionality.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located near the top left of the screen, to the right of the \\'Plan a route\\' text. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface where I can input \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon at [145, 170] successfully opened the search interface. However, the search bar was pre-filled with the previous search term, \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\', instead of being empty. This means an extra step is required to clear the search bar before inputting the new location \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by opening the search interface, but the pre-filled text needs to be handled.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.42\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 167, 100, 668], \\'text\\': \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [133, 126, 151, 371], \\'text\\': \\'SHOW ON MAP\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [202, 130, 244, 370], \\'text\\': \\'Liechtenstein Country\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [203, 851, 217, 965], \\'text\\': \\'3296 mi\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [274, 314, 288, 689], \\'text\\': \\'INCREASE SEARCH RADIUS\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 40, 41, 245]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 910, 100, 976]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.43\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 170, 100, 519], \\'text\\': \\'Type to search all\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 87, 151, 250], \\'text\\': \\'HISTORY\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 385, 150, 619], \\'text\\': \\'CATEGORIES\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 748, 150, 921], \\'text\\': \\'ADDRESS\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [115, 1, 170, 333]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [115, 333, 169, 680]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [115, 682, 169, 992]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 42, 40, 243]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 362, 1000, 633]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nSave a track with waypoints Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein, Triesen, Liechtenstein, Bendern, Liechtenstein in the OsmAnd maps app in the same order as listed.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located to the right of the \\'Plan a route\\' text at the top left of the screen. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface where I can input \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the search icon at [145, 170] was successful. It opened a search interface. The text field \\'Type to search all\\' is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is visible, ready for text input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\\' into the focused search field \\'Type to search all\\'. The text field is currently focused and has placeholder text. This action is predicted to replace the placeholder text with \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' and then initiate a search for this location because of the trailing newline character. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\\' was successful. The text was entered into the search field, and the search was initiated. The screen now displays search results, with \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' in the search bar and options like \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' and \\'Liechtenstein Country\\' below it. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' as the first waypoint.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is associated with the search result \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. This button is currently visible on the screen. This action is predicted to select \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' and potentially show it on the map, which is a step towards adding it as the first waypoint. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button for \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' was successful. The application transitioned from the search results screen to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\', and this location is indicated by the title at the top of the screen. The bottom panel shows \"Point - 1 Start\" and \"0 ft, points: 1\", which implies that \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' has been set as the first waypoint. This action successfully completed the active subgoal of adding the first waypoint. The UI is now ready for adding subsequent waypoints.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,864],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, which is located at the bottom right of the screen (center of the icon with bounding box [925, 745, 966, 983]). This action is predicted to add a new waypoint to the current route. The \\'points: 1\\' indicator should change to \\'points: 2\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 864] did not add a new waypoint to the route. The primary change observed is that the title at the top of the screen changed from \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' to \\'Plan a route\\'. The number of waypoints displayed in the bottom panel remained \\'1\\' (\\'0 ft, points: 1\\'). This action did not directly advance the goal of adding the second waypoint, but it returned the UI to a state where route planning actions, like searching for waypoints, can be initiated. The next step should be to use the search functionality.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located near the top left of the screen, to the right of the \\'Plan a route\\' text. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface where I can input \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon at [145, 170] successfully opened the search interface. However, the search bar was pre-filled with the previous search term, \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\', instead of being empty. This means an extra step is required to clear the search bar before inputting the new location \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by opening the search interface, but the pre-filled text needs to be handled.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 13: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (close icon) located at approximately [85, 943], which is to the right of the text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' in the search bar. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to clear the text from the search bar, allowing for the input of \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open OsmAnd app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The OsmAnd app\\'s main screen is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled down, and tapped on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The UI is now ready for adding subsequent waypoints.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,864],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, which is located at the bottom right of the screen (center of the icon with bounding box [925, 745, 966, 983]). This action is predicted to add a new waypoint to the current route. The \\'points: 1\\' indicator should change to \\'points: 2\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 864] did not add a new waypoint to the route. The primary change observed is that the title at the top of the screen changed from \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' to \\'Plan a route\\'. The number of waypoints displayed in the bottom panel remained \\'1\\' (\\'0 ft, points: 1\\'). This action did not directly advance the goal of adding the second waypoint, but it returned the UI to a state where route planning actions, like searching for waypoints, can be initiated. The next step should be to use the search functionality.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located near the top left of the screen, to the right of the \\'Plan a route\\' text. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface where I can input \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon at [145, 170] successfully opened the search interface. However, the search bar was pre-filled with the previous search term, \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\', instead of being empty. This means an extra step is required to clear the search bar before inputting the new location \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by opening the search interface, but the pre-filled text needs to be handled.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (close icon) located at approximately [85, 943], which is to the right of the text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' in the search bar. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to clear the text from the search bar, allowing for the input of \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'X\\' icon at [85, 943] was successful. The text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' was cleared from the search bar. The search bar now displays the placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\'. This action successfully completed the first planned step of the active subgoal and brought the agent closer to adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.43\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 170, 100, 519], \\'text\\': \\'Type to search all\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 87, 151, 250], \\'text\\': \\'HISTORY\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 385, 150, 619], \\'text\\': \\'CATEGORIES\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 748, 150, 921], \\'text\\': \\'ADDRESS\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [115, 1, 170, 333]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [115, 333, 169, 680]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [115, 682, 169, 992]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 42, 40, 243]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 362, 1000, 633]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field is currently focused and has placeholder text. This action is predicted to replace the placeholder text with \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' and then initiate a search for this location because of the trailing newline character. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\\\n\\' was successful. The text was entered into the search field, and the search was initiated. The screen now displays search results, with \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' in the search bar and options like \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' and \\'Liechtenstein Country\\' below it.

This button is currently visible on the screen. This action is predicted to select \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' and potentially show it on the map, which is a step towards adding it as the first waypoint. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button for \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' was successful. The application transitioned from the search results screen to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\', and this location is indicated by the title at the top of the screen. The bottom panel shows \"Point - 1 Start\" and \"0 ft, points: 1\", which implies that \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' has been set as the first waypoint.

This action is predicted to add a new waypoint to the current route. The \\'points: 1\\' indicator should change to \\'points: 2\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 864] did not add a new waypoint to the route. The primary change observed is that the title at the top of the screen changed from \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' to \\'Plan a route\\'. The number of waypoints displayed in the bottom panel remained \\'1\\' (\\'0 ft, points: 1\\'). This action did not directly advance the goal of adding the second waypoint, but it returned the UI to a state where route planning actions, like searching for waypoints, can be initiated. The next step should be to use the search functionality.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface where I can input \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon at [145, 170] successfully opened the search interface. However, the search bar was pre-filled with the previous search term, \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\', instead of being empty. This means an extra step is required to clear the search bar before inputting the new location \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by opening the search interface, but the pre-filled text needs to be handled.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (close icon) located at approximately [85, 943], which is to the right of the text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' in the search bar. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to clear the text from the search bar, allowing for the input of \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'X\\' icon at [85, 943] was successful. The text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' was cleared from the search bar. The search bar now displays the placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\'. This action successfully completed the first planned step of the active subgoal and brought the agent closer to adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 14: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This button is currently visible on the screen. This action is predicted to select \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' and potentially show it on the map, which is a step towards adding it as the first waypoint. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button for \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' was successful. The application transitioned from the search results screen to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\', and this location is indicated by the title at the top of the screen. The bottom panel shows \"Point - 1 Start\" and \"0 ft, points: 1\", which implies that \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' has been set as the first waypoint. This action successfully completed the active subgoal of adding the first waypoint. The UI is now ready for adding subsequent waypoints.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,864],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, which is located at the bottom right of the screen (center of the icon with bounding box [925, 745, 966, 983]). This action is predicted to add a new waypoint to the current route. The \\'points: 1\\' indicator should change to \\'points: 2\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 864] did not add a new waypoint to the route. The primary change observed is that the title at the top of the screen changed from \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' to \\'Plan a route\\'. The number of waypoints displayed in the bottom panel remained \\'1\\' (\\'0 ft, points: 1\\'). This action did not directly advance the goal of adding the second waypoint, but it returned the UI to a state where route planning actions, like searching for waypoints, can be initiated. The next step should be to use the search functionality.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface where I can input \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon at [145, 170] successfully opened the search interface. However, the search bar was pre-filled with the previous search term, \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\', instead of being empty. This means an extra step is required to clear the search bar before inputting the new location \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by opening the search interface, but the pre-filled text needs to be handled.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to clear the text from the search bar, allowing for the input of \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'X\\' icon at [85, 943] was successful. The text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' was cleared from the search bar. The search bar now displays the placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\'. This action successfully completed the first planned step of the active subgoal and brought the agent closer to adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,344],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Type to search all\\' text field, which has bounding box [74, 170, 100, 519]. The text field currently displays placeholder text. This action is predicted to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Type to search all\\' text field at [87, 344] was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' message at the bottom of the screen. This action has prepared the interface for text input, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.43\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 170, 99, 519], \\'text\\': \\'fype to search all\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 87, 151, 250], \\'text\\': \\'HISTORY\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 385, 150, 619], \\'text\\': \\'CATEGORIES\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 748, 150, 921], \\'text\\': \\'ADDRESS\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [115, 0, 170, 333]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [115, 333, 169, 681]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [115, 682, 169, 996]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 42, 40, 243]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"Type to search all\", resource-id=\"net.osmand:id/searchEditText\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.osmand\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[189,128][1080,275]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Type to search all\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is associated with the search result \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\'. This button is currently visible on the screen. This action is predicted to select \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' and potentially show it on the map, which is a step towards adding it as the first waypoint. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button for \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' was successful. The application transitioned from the search results screen to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\', and this location is indicated by the title at the top of the screen. The bottom panel shows \"Point - 1 Start\" and \"0 ft, points: 1\", which implies that \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' has been set as the first waypoint. This action successfully completed the active subgoal of adding the first waypoint. The UI is now ready for adding subsequent waypoints.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,864],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, which is located at the bottom right of the screen (center of the icon with bounding box [925, 745, 966, 983]). This action is predicted to add a new waypoint to the current route. The \\'points: 1\\' indicator should change to \\'points: 2\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 864] did not add a new waypoint to the route. The primary change observed is that the title at the top of the screen changed from \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' to \\'Plan a route\\'. The number of waypoints displayed in the bottom panel remained \\'1\\' (\\'0 ft, points: 1\\'). This action did not directly advance the goal of adding the second waypoint, but it returned the UI to a state where route planning actions, like searching for waypoints, can be initiated. The next step should be to use the search functionality.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located near the top left of the screen, to the right of the \\'Plan a route\\' text. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface where I can input \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon at [145, 170] successfully opened the search interface. However, the search bar was pre-filled with the previous search term, \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\', instead of being empty. This means an extra step is required to clear the search bar before inputting the new location \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by opening the search interface, but the pre-filled text needs to be handled.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (close icon) located at approximately [85, 943], which is to the right of the text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' in the search bar. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to clear the text from the search bar, allowing for the input of \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'X\\' icon at [85, 943] was successful. The text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' was cleared from the search bar.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,864],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, which is located at the bottom right of the screen (center of the icon with bounding box [925, 745, 966, 983]). This action is predicted to add a new waypoint to the current route. The \\'points: 1\\' indicator should change to \\'points: 2\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 864] did not add a new waypoint to the route. The primary change observed is that the title at the top of the screen changed from \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' to \\'Plan a route\\'. The number of waypoints displayed in the bottom panel remained \\'1\\' (\\'0 ft, points: 1\\'). This action did not directly advance the goal of adding the second waypoint, but it returned the UI to a state where route planning actions, like searching for waypoints, can be initiated. The next step should be to use the search functionality.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located near the top left of the screen, to the right of the \\'Plan a route\\' text. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface where I can input \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon at [145, 170] successfully opened the search interface. However, the search bar was pre-filled with the previous search term, \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\', instead of being empty. This means an extra step is required to clear the search bar before inputting the new location \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by opening the search interface, but the pre-filled text needs to be handled.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (close icon) located at approximately [85, 943], which is to the right of the text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' in the search bar. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to clear the text from the search bar, allowing for the input of \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'X\\' icon at [85, 943] was successful. The text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' was cleared from the search bar. The search bar now displays the placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\'. This action successfully completed the first planned step of the active subgoal and brought the agent closer to adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,344],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Type to search all\\' text field, which has bounding box [74, 170, 100, 519]. The text field currently displays placeholder text. This action is predicted to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Type to search all\\' text field at [87, 344] was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' message at the bottom of the screen. This action has prepared the interface for text input, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Triesen, Liechtenstein\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' into the currently focused search field, which displays \\'Type to search all\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with the input text. After this action, the search field should contain \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and search results should appear or a search confirmation (e.g., pressing enter) will be needed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' into the search field was successful. The text \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' is now present in the search bar, and search results are displayed below it. The most prominent result is \\'Liechtenstein Country\\', but the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button is likely associated with the text in the search bar. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the second waypoint.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.44\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 169, 97, 602], \\'text\\': \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [133, 126, 151, 371], \\'text\\': \\'SHOW ON MAP\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [202, 130, 244, 370], \\'text\\': \\'Liechtenstein Country\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [203, 851, 217, 965], \\'text\\': \\'3296 mi\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [274, 314, 288, 689], \\'text\\': \\'INCREASE SEARCH RADIUS\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 37, 42, 247]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 908, 101, 979]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"Triesen, Liechtenstein\", resource-id=\"net.osmand:id/searchEditText\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.osmand\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[189,128][954,275]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Triesen, Liechtenstein\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,864],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, which is located at the bottom right of the screen (center of the icon with bounding box [925, 745, 966, 983]). This action is predicted to add a new waypoint to the current route. The \\'points: 1\\' indicator should change to \\'points: 2\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 864] did not add a new waypoint to the route. The primary change observed is that the title at the top of the screen changed from \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' to \\'Plan a route\\'. The number of waypoints displayed in the bottom panel remained \\'1\\' (\\'0 ft, points: 1\\'). This action did not directly advance the goal of adding the second waypoint, but it returned the UI to a state where route planning actions, like searching for waypoints, can be initiated. The next step should be to use the search functionality.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located near the top left of the screen, to the right of the \\'Plan a route\\' text. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface where I can input \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon at [145, 170] successfully opened the search interface. However, the search bar was pre-filled with the previous search term, \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\', instead of being empty. This means an extra step is required to clear the search bar before inputting the new location \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by opening the search interface, but the pre-filled text needs to be handled.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (close icon) located at approximately [85, 943], which is to the right of the text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' in the search bar. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to clear the text from the search bar, allowing for the input of \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'X\\' icon at [85, 943] was successful. The text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' was cleared from the search bar. The search bar now displays the placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\'. This action successfully completed the first planned step of the active subgoal and brought the agent closer to adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,344],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Type to search all\\' text field, which has bounding box [74, 170, 100, 519]. The text field currently displays placeholder text. This action is predicted to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Type to search all\\' text field at [87, 344] was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' message at the bottom of the screen. This action has prepared the interface for text input, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Triesen, Liechtenstein\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' into the currently focused search field, which displays \\'Type to search all\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with the input text. After this action, the search field should contain \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and search results should appear or a search confirmation (e.g., pressing enter) will be needed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' into the search field was successful. The text \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' is now present in the search bar, and search results are displayed below it.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface where I can input \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon at [145, 170] successfully opened the search interface. However, the search bar was pre-filled with the previous search term, \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\', instead of being empty. This means an extra step is required to clear the search bar before inputting the new location \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by opening the search interface, but the pre-filled text needs to be handled.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (close icon) located at approximately [85, 943], which is to the right of the text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' in the search bar. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to clear the text from the search bar, allowing for the input of \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'X\\' icon at [85, 943] was successful. The text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' was cleared from the search bar. The search bar now displays the placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\'. This action successfully completed the first planned step of the active subgoal and brought the agent closer to adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,344],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Type to search all\\' text field, which has bounding box [74, 170, 100, 519]. The text field currently displays placeholder text. This action is predicted to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Type to search all\\' text field at [87, 344] was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' message at the bottom of the screen. This action has prepared the interface for text input, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Triesen, Liechtenstein\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' into the currently focused search field, which displays \\'Type to search all\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with the input text. After this action, the search field should contain \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and search results should appear or a search confirmation (e.g., pressing enter) will be needed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' into the search field was successful. The text \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' is now present in the search bar, and search results are displayed below it. The most prominent result is \\'Liechtenstein Country\\', but the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button is likely associated with the text in the search bar. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the second waypoint.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is located below the search bar and has the text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' with bounding box [133, 126, 151, 371]. This action is predicted to select \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' and add it as the second waypoint to the route. The map should then center on this location, and the waypoint count should increase. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' at [142, 248] successfully changed the screen from the search results to the map view, centering the map on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. However, it did not add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint to the route. The point count remained \\'1\\'. The action was partially successful in that it located the desired waypoint on the map, but it did not complete the addition of the waypoint.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[145,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located near the top left of the screen, to the right of the \\'Plan a route\\' text. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a search interface where I can input \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the search icon at [145, 170] successfully opened the search interface. However, the search bar was pre-filled with the previous search term, \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\', instead of being empty. This means an extra step is required to clear the search bar before inputting the new location \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by opening the search interface, but the pre-filled text needs to be handled.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (close icon) located at approximately [85, 943], which is to the right of the text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' in the search bar. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to clear the text from the search bar, allowing for the input of \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'X\\' icon at [85, 943] was successful. The text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' was cleared from the search bar. The search bar now displays the placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\'. This action successfully completed the first planned step of the active subgoal and brought the agent closer to adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,344],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Type to search all\\' text field, which has bounding box [74, 170, 100, 519]. The text field currently displays placeholder text. This action is predicted to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Type to search all\\' text field at [87, 344] was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' message at the bottom of the screen. This action has prepared the interface for text input, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Triesen, Liechtenstein\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' into the currently focused search field, which displays \\'Type to search all\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with the input text. After this action, the search field should contain \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and search results should appear or a search confirmation (e.g., pressing enter) will be needed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' into the search field was successful. The text \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' is now present in the search bar, and search results are displayed below it. The most prominent result is \\'Liechtenstein Country\\', but the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button is likely associated with the text in the search bar. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the second waypoint.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is located below the search bar and has the text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' with bounding box [133, 126, 151, 371]. This action is predicted to select \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' and add it as the second waypoint to the route. The map should then center on this location, and the waypoint count should increase. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' at [142, 248] successfully changed the screen from the search results to the map view, centering the map on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. However, it did not add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint to the route. The point count remained \\'1\\'. The action was partially successful in that it located the desired waypoint on the map, but it did not complete the addition of the waypoint. To complete the addition, the \\'Add\\' button needs to be tapped.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 17: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location, \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open OsmAnd app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The OsmAnd app\\'s main screen is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled down, and tapped on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current hypothesis is that tapping the 'Add' button again, now that the screen is in the 'Plan a route' state and the map is (presumably) still centered on 'Triesen, Liechtenstein', will add the waypoint.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (close icon) located at approximately [85, 943], which is to the right of the text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' in the search bar. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to clear the text from the search bar, allowing for the input of \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'X\\' icon at [85, 943] was successful. The text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' was cleared from the search bar. The search bar now displays the placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\'. This action successfully completed the first planned step of the active subgoal and brought the agent closer to adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,344],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Type to search all\\' text field, which has bounding box [74, 170, 100, 519]. The text field currently displays placeholder text. This action is predicted to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Type to search all\\' text field at [87, 344] was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' message at the bottom of the screen. This action has prepared the interface for text input, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Triesen, Liechtenstein\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' into the currently focused search field, which displays \\'Type to search all\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with the input text. After this action, the search field should contain \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and search results should appear or a search confirmation (e.g., pressing enter) will be needed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' into the search field was successful. The text \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' is now present in the search bar, and search results are displayed below it. The most prominent result is \\'Liechtenstein Country\\', but the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button is likely associated with the text in the search bar. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the second waypoint.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is located below the search bar and has the text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' with bounding box [133, 126, 151, 371]. This action is predicted to select \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' and add it as the second waypoint to the route. The map should then center on this location, and the waypoint count should increase. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' at [142, 248] successfully changed the screen from the search results to the map view, centering the map on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. However, it did not add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint to the route. The point count remained \\'1\\'. The action was partially successful in that it located the desired waypoint on the map, but it did not complete the addition of the waypoint. To complete the addition, the \\'Add\\' button needs to be tapped.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location, \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 865] did not add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. Before the action, the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and the title was \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. After the action, the title changed to \\'Plan a route\\', but the point count remained \\'1\\', and no new waypoint was added to the list. The action did not directly achieve the goal of adding the waypoint but changed the screen context. It\\'s possible this was a necessary intermediate step. To proceed, the \\'Add\\' button will be tapped again, assuming the map is still centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,943],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (close icon) located at approximately [85, 943], which is to the right of the text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' in the search bar. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to clear the text from the search bar, allowing for the input of \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'X\\' icon at [85, 943] was successful. The text \\'Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein\\' was cleared from the search bar. The search bar now displays the placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\'. This action successfully completed the first planned step of the active subgoal and brought the agent closer to adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,344],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Type to search all\\' text field, which has bounding box [74, 170, 100, 519]. The text field currently displays placeholder text. This action is predicted to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Type to search all\\' text field at [87, 344] was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' message at the bottom of the screen. This action has prepared the interface for text input, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Triesen, Liechtenstein\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' into the currently focused search field, which displays \\'Type to search all\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with the input text. After this action, the search field should contain \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and search results should appear or a search confirmation (e.g., pressing enter) will be needed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' into the search field was successful. The text \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' is now present in the search bar, and search results are displayed below it. The most prominent result is \\'Liechtenstein Country\\', but the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button is likely associated with the text in the search bar. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the second waypoint.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is located below the search bar and has the text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' with bounding box [133, 126, 151, 371]. This action is predicted to select \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' and add it as the second waypoint to the route. The map should then center on this location, and the waypoint count should increase. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' at [142, 248] successfully changed the screen from the search results to the map view, centering the map on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. However, it did not add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint to the route. The point count remained \\'1\\'. The action was partially successful in that it located the desired waypoint on the map, but it did not complete the addition of the waypoint. To complete the addition, the \\'Add\\' button needs to be tapped.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location, \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 865] did not add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. Before the action, the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and the title was \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. After the action, the title changed to \\'Plan a route\\', but the point count remained \\'1\\', and no new waypoint was added to the list. The action did not directly achieve the goal of adding the waypoint but changed the screen context. It\\'s possible this was a necessary intermediate step. To proceed, the \\'Add\\' button will be tapped again, assuming the map is still centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 18: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (which should be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The first failure (Step 17) occurred when the 'Add' button was tapped after 'SHOW ON MAP' for Triesen (when the title was 'Triesen, Liechtenstein'); that tap changed the title to 'Plan a route' but did not add the point.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,344],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Type to search all\\' text field, which has bounding box [74, 170, 100, 519]. The text field currently displays placeholder text. This action is predicted to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Type to search all\\' text field at [87, 344] was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' message at the bottom of the screen. This action has prepared the interface for text input, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Triesen, Liechtenstein\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' into the currently focused search field, which displays \\'Type to search all\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with the input text. After this action, the search field should contain \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and search results should appear or a search confirmation (e.g., pressing enter) will be needed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' into the search field was successful. The text \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' is now present in the search bar, and search results are displayed below it. The most prominent result is \\'Liechtenstein Country\\', but the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button is likely associated with the text in the search bar. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the second waypoint.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is located below the search bar and has the text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' with bounding box [133, 126, 151, 371]. This action is predicted to select \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' and add it as the second waypoint to the route. The map should then center on this location, and the waypoint count should increase. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' at [142, 248] successfully changed the screen from the search results to the map view, centering the map on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. However, it did not add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint to the route. The point count remained \\'1\\'. The action was partially successful in that it located the desired waypoint on the map, but it did not complete the addition of the waypoint. To complete the addition, the \\'Add\\' button needs to be tapped.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location, \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 865] did not add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. Before the action, the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and the title was \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. After the action, the title changed to \\'Plan a route\\', but the point count remained \\'1\\', and no new waypoint was added to the list. The action did not directly achieve the goal of adding the waypoint but changed the screen context. It\\'s possible this was a necessary intermediate step. To proceed, the \\'Add\\' button will be tapped again, assuming the map is still centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (which should be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Add\\' button, located at approximately [945, 865]. The screen title was \\'Plan a route\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was the only waypoint listed, with a point count of 1. The intended outcome was to add the currently centered location (expected to be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' from the previous search in step 15 and \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' in step 16) as the second waypoint. However, the action had no discernible effect on the UI. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint visible. The action failed to add the waypoint and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,344],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Type to search all\\' text field, which has bounding box [74, 170, 100, 519]. The text field currently displays placeholder text. This action is predicted to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Type to search all\\' text field at [87, 344] was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard is active, as indicated by the \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' message at the bottom of the screen. This action has prepared the interface for text input, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Triesen, Liechtenstein\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' into the currently focused search field, which displays \\'Type to search all\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with the input text. After this action, the search field should contain \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and search results should appear or a search confirmation (e.g., pressing enter) will be needed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' into the search field was successful. The text \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' is now present in the search bar, and search results are displayed below it. The most prominent result is \\'Liechtenstein Country\\', but the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button is likely associated with the text in the search bar. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the second waypoint.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is located below the search bar and has the text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' with bounding box [133, 126, 151, 371]. This action is predicted to select \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' and add it as the second waypoint to the route. The map should then center on this location, and the waypoint count should increase. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' at [142, 248] successfully changed the screen from the search results to the map view, centering the map on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. However, it did not add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint to the route. The point count remained \\'1\\'. The action was partially successful in that it located the desired waypoint on the map, but it did not complete the addition of the waypoint. To complete the addition, the \\'Add\\' button needs to be tapped.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location, \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 865] did not add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. Before the action, the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and the title was \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. After the action, the title changed to \\'Plan a route\\', but the point count remained \\'1\\', and no new waypoint was added to the list. The action did not directly achieve the goal of adding the waypoint but changed the screen context. It\\'s possible this was a necessary intermediate step. To proceed, the \\'Add\\' button will be tapped again, assuming the map is still centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (which should be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Add\\' button, located at approximately [945, 865]. The screen title was \\'Plan a route\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was the only waypoint listed, with a point count of 1. The intended outcome was to add the currently centered location (expected to be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' from the previous search in step 15 and \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' in step 16) as the second waypoint. However, the action had no discernible effect on the UI. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint visible. The action failed to add the waypoint and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 19: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[147,175],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at approximately [147, 175]. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open the search interface, allowing for the input of \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is likely because \"Triesen, Liechtenstein\" was the last searched term (from step 15). This is a positive development as it skips the need to re-type the location. The current screen shows \"Triesen, Liechtenstein\" as the title and a \"SHOW ON MAP\" button. The active subgoal is to add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint.

This action will replace the placeholder text with the input text. After this action, the search field should contain \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and search results should appear or a search confirmation (e.g., pressing enter) will be needed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' into the search field was successful. The text \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' is now present in the search bar, and search results are displayed below it. The most prominent result is \\'Liechtenstein Country\\', but the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button is likely associated with the text in the search bar. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the second waypoint.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is located below the search bar and has the text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' with bounding box [133, 126, 151, 371]. This action is predicted to select \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' and add it as the second waypoint to the route. The map should then center on this location, and the waypoint count should increase. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' at [142, 248] successfully changed the screen from the search results to the map view, centering the map on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. However, it did not add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint to the route. The point count remained \\'1\\'. The action was partially successful in that it located the desired waypoint on the map, but it did not complete the addition of the waypoint. To complete the addition, the \\'Add\\' button needs to be tapped.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location, \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 865] did not add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. Before the action, the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and the title was \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. After the action, the title changed to \\'Plan a route\\', but the point count remained \\'1\\', and no new waypoint was added to the list. The action did not directly achieve the goal of adding the waypoint but changed the screen context. It\\'s possible this was a necessary intermediate step. To proceed, the \\'Add\\' button will be tapped again, assuming the map is still centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (which should be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Add\\' button, located at approximately [945, 865]. The screen title was \\'Plan a route\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was the only waypoint listed, with a point count of 1. The intended outcome was to add the currently centered location (expected to be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' from the previous search in step 15 and \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' in step 16) as the second waypoint. However, the action had no discernible effect on the UI. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint visible. The action failed to add the waypoint and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[147,175],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at approximately [147, 175]. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open the search interface, allowing for the input of \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the search icon at [147, 175]. Before the action, the screen was in the \\'Plan a route\\' map view. After the action, the screen changed to display search results for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The title is \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button is visible. This action was successful in opening the search interface and, unexpectedly, it pre-filled or recalled the previous search for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step in the plan is to tap \\'SHOW ON MAP\\'.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.48\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 170, 96, 600], \\'text\\': \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [133, 126, 151, 371], \\'text\\': \\'SHOW ON MAP\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [202, 130, 244, 370], \\'text\\': \\'Liechtenstein Country\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [203, 851, 217, 965], \\'text\\': \\'3296 mi\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [274, 314, 288, 689], \\'text\\': \\'INCREASE SEARCH RADIUS\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 40, 40, 245]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 910, 100, 976]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action will replace the placeholder text with the input text. After this action, the search field should contain \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and search results should appear or a search confirmation (e.g., pressing enter) will be needed. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' into the search field was successful. The text \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' is now present in the search bar, and search results are displayed below it. The most prominent result is \\'Liechtenstein Country\\', but the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button is likely associated with the text in the search bar. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the second waypoint.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is located below the search bar and has the text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' with bounding box [133, 126, 151, 371]. This action is predicted to select \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' and add it as the second waypoint to the route. The map should then center on this location, and the waypoint count should increase. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' at [142, 248] successfully changed the screen from the search results to the map view, centering the map on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. However, it did not add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint to the route. The point count remained \\'1\\'. The action was partially successful in that it located the desired waypoint on the map, but it did not complete the addition of the waypoint. To complete the addition, the \\'Add\\' button needs to be tapped.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location, \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 865] did not add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. Before the action, the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and the title was \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. After the action, the title changed to \\'Plan a route\\', but the point count remained \\'1\\', and no new waypoint was added to the list. The action did not directly achieve the goal of adding the waypoint but changed the screen context. It\\'s possible this was a necessary intermediate step. To proceed, the \\'Add\\' button will be tapped again, assuming the map is still centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (which should be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Add\\' button, located at approximately [945, 865]. The screen title was \\'Plan a route\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was the only waypoint listed, with a point count of 1. The intended outcome was to add the currently centered location (expected to be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' from the previous search in step 15 and \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' in step 16) as the second waypoint. However, the action had no discernible effect on the UI. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint visible. The action failed to add the waypoint and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[147,175],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at approximately [147, 175]. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open the search interface, allowing for the input of \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the search icon at [147, 175]. Before the action, the screen was in the \\'Plan a route\\' map view. After the action, the screen changed to display search results for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The title is \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button is visible. This action was successful in opening the search interface and, unexpectedly, it pre-filled or recalled the previous search for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step in the plan is to tap \\'SHOW ON MAP\\'.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 20: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is associated with \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The button has text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' and is located at approximately [142, 248]. This action is predicted to center the map on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' and prepare it for being added as a waypoint. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open OsmAnd app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The OsmAnd app\\'s main screen is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled down, and tapped on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is located below the search bar and has the text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' with bounding box [133, 126, 151, 371]. This action is predicted to select \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' and add it as the second waypoint to the route. The map should then center on this location, and the waypoint count should increase. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' at [142, 248] successfully changed the screen from the search results to the map view, centering the map on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. However, it did not add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint to the route. The point count remained \\'1\\'. The action was partially successful in that it located the desired waypoint on the map, but it did not complete the addition of the waypoint. To complete the addition, the \\'Add\\' button needs to be tapped.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location, \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 865] did not add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. Before the action, the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and the title was \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. After the action, the title changed to \\'Plan a route\\', but the point count remained \\'1\\', and no new waypoint was added to the list. The action did not directly achieve the goal of adding the waypoint but changed the screen context. It\\'s possible this was a necessary intermediate step. To proceed, the \\'Add\\' button will be tapped again, assuming the map is still centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (which should be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Add\\' button, located at approximately [945, 865]. The screen title was \\'Plan a route\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was the only waypoint listed, with a point count of 1. The intended outcome was to add the currently centered location (expected to be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' from the previous search in step 15 and \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' in step 16) as the second waypoint. However, the action had no discernible effect on the UI. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint visible. The action failed to add the waypoint and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[147,175],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at approximately [147, 175]. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open the search interface, allowing for the input of \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the search icon at [147, 175]. Before the action, the screen was in the \\'Plan a route\\' map view. After the action, the screen changed to display search results for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The title is \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button is visible. This action was successful in opening the search interface and, unexpectedly, it pre-filled or recalled the previous search for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step in the plan is to tap \\'SHOW ON MAP\\'.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is associated with \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The button has text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' and is located at approximately [142, 248]. This action is predicted to center the map on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' and prepare it for being added as a waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' at [142, 248] was successful. The screen changed from the search results for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and the title at the top of the screen confirms this. The list of waypoints still shows \\'Point - 1 Start\\', and the point count is \\'1\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the map for adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as a waypoint.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is located below the search bar and has the text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' with bounding box [133, 126, 151, 371]. This action is predicted to select \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' and add it as the second waypoint to the route. The map should then center on this location, and the waypoint count should increase. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' at [142, 248] successfully changed the screen from the search results to the map view, centering the map on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. However, it did not add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint to the route. The point count remained \\'1\\'. The action was partially successful in that it located the desired waypoint on the map, but it did not complete the addition of the waypoint. To complete the addition, the \\'Add\\' button needs to be tapped.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location, \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 865] did not add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. Before the action, the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and the title was \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. After the action, the title changed to \\'Plan a route\\', but the point count remained \\'1\\', and no new waypoint was added to the list. The action did not directly achieve the goal of adding the waypoint but changed the screen context. It\\'s possible this was a necessary intermediate step. To proceed, the \\'Add\\' button will be tapped again, assuming the map is still centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (which should be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Add\\' button, located at approximately [945, 865]. The screen title was \\'Plan a route\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was the only waypoint listed, with a point count of 1. The intended outcome was to add the currently centered location (expected to be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' from the previous search in step 15 and \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' in step 16) as the second waypoint. However, the action had no discernible effect on the UI. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint visible. The action failed to add the waypoint and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[147,175],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at approximately [147, 175]. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open the search interface, allowing for the input of \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the search icon at [147, 175]. Before the action, the screen was in the \\'Plan a route\\' map view. After the action, the screen changed to display search results for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The title is \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button is visible. This action was successful in opening the search interface and, unexpectedly, it pre-filled or recalled the previous search for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step in the plan is to tap \\'SHOW ON MAP\\'.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is associated with \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The button has text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' and is located at approximately [142, 248]. This action is predicted to center the map on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' and prepare it for being added as a waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' at [142, 248] was successful. The screen changed from the search results for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and the title at the top of the screen confirms this. The list of waypoints still shows \\'Point - 1 Start\\', and the point count is \\'1\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the map for adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as a waypoint.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 21: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[947,99],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Options\\' button, located at the bottom left of the screen (center approximately at [947, 99], with text \\'Options\\' and bounding box [937, 35, 958, 164]). This action is predicted to open a menu with further options, including \\'Add as new point\\'.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location, \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 865] did not add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. Before the action, the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and the title was \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. After the action, the title changed to \\'Plan a route\\', but the point count remained \\'1\\', and no new waypoint was added to the list. The action did not directly achieve the goal of adding the waypoint but changed the screen context. It\\'s possible this was a necessary intermediate step. To proceed, the \\'Add\\' button will be tapped again, assuming the map is still centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (which should be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Add\\' button, located at approximately [945, 865]. The screen title was \\'Plan a route\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was the only waypoint listed, with a point count of 1. The intended outcome was to add the currently centered location (expected to be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' from the previous search in step 15 and \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' in step 16) as the second waypoint. However, the action had no discernible effect on the UI. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint visible. The action failed to add the waypoint and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[147,175],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at approximately [147, 175]. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open the search interface, allowing for the input of \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the search icon at [147, 175]. Before the action, the screen was in the \\'Plan a route\\' map view. After the action, the screen changed to display search results for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The title is \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button is visible. This action was successful in opening the search interface and, unexpectedly, it pre-filled or recalled the previous search for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step in the plan is to tap \\'SHOW ON MAP\\'.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is associated with \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The button has text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' and is located at approximately [142, 248]. This action is predicted to center the map on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' and prepare it for being added as a waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' at [142, 248] was successful. The screen changed from the search results for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and the title at the top of the screen confirms this. The list of waypoints still shows \\'Point - 1 Start\\', and the point count is \\'1\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the map for adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as a waypoint.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[947,99],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Options\\' button, located at the bottom left of the screen (center approximately at [947, 99], with text \\'Options\\' and bounding box [937, 35, 958, 164]). This action is predicted to open a menu with further options, including \\'Add as new point\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action was tapping the \\'Options\\' button (located at the bottom left, text \\'Options\\'). This action successfully opened a pop-up menu titled \\'Options\\', which is now displayed on the screen. This menu contains various actions related to the route or track. However, the anticipated option \\'Add as new point\\' is not available in this menu. While the action of opening the menu was successful, it did not lead to the expected path for adding the waypoint. The plan needs to be revised to close this menu and attempt adding the waypoint using the \\'Add\\' button on the main map screen.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location, \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 865] did not add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. Before the action, the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and the title was \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. After the action, the title changed to \\'Plan a route\\', but the point count remained \\'1\\', and no new waypoint was added to the list. The action did not directly achieve the goal of adding the waypoint but changed the screen context. It\\'s possible this was a necessary intermediate step. To proceed, the \\'Add\\' button will be tapped again, assuming the map is still centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (which should be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Add\\' button, located at approximately [945, 865]. The screen title was \\'Plan a route\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was the only waypoint listed, with a point count of 1. The intended outcome was to add the currently centered location (expected to be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' from the previous search in step 15 and \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' in step 16) as the second waypoint. However, the action had no discernible effect on the UI. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint visible. The action failed to add the waypoint and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[147,175],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at approximately [147, 175]. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open the search interface, allowing for the input of \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the search icon at [147, 175]. Before the action, the screen was in the \\'Plan a route\\' map view. After the action, the screen changed to display search results for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The title is \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button is visible. This action was successful in opening the search interface and, unexpectedly, it pre-filled or recalled the previous search for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step in the plan is to tap \\'SHOW ON MAP\\'.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is associated with \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The button has text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' and is located at approximately [142, 248]. This action is predicted to center the map on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' and prepare it for being added as a waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' at [142, 248] was successful. The screen changed from the search results for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and the title at the top of the screen confirms this. The list of waypoints still shows \\'Point - 1 Start\\', and the point count is \\'1\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the map for adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as a waypoint.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[947,99],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Options\\' button, located at the bottom left of the screen (center approximately at [947, 99], with text \\'Options\\' and bounding box [937, 35, 958, 164]). This action is predicted to open a menu with further options, including \\'Add as new point\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action was tapping the \\'Options\\' button (located at the bottom left, text \\'Options\\'). This action successfully opened a pop-up menu titled \\'Options\\', which is now displayed on the screen. This menu contains various actions related to the route or track. However, the anticipated option \\'Add as new point\\' is not available in this menu. While the action of opening the menu was successful, it did not lead to the expected path for adding the waypoint. The plan needs to be revised to close this menu and attempt adding the waypoint using the \\'Add\\' button on the main map screen.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 22: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[941,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close\\' button, located at the bottom of the \\'Options\\' menu (center approximately at [941, 501], with text \\'Close\\' and bounding box [934, 455, 949, 547]).

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (which should be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Add\\' button, located at approximately [945, 865]. The screen title was \\'Plan a route\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was the only waypoint listed, with a point count of 1. The intended outcome was to add the currently centered location (expected to be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' from the previous search in step 15 and \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' in step 16) as the second waypoint. However, the action had no discernible effect on the UI. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint visible. The action failed to add the waypoint and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[147,175],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at approximately [147, 175]. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open the search interface, allowing for the input of \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the search icon at [147, 175]. Before the action, the screen was in the \\'Plan a route\\' map view. After the action, the screen changed to display search results for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The title is \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button is visible. This action was successful in opening the search interface and, unexpectedly, it pre-filled or recalled the previous search for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step in the plan is to tap \\'SHOW ON MAP\\'.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is associated with \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The button has text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' and is located at approximately [142, 248]. This action is predicted to center the map on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' and prepare it for being added as a waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' at [142, 248] was successful. The screen changed from the search results for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and the title at the top of the screen confirms this. The list of waypoints still shows \\'Point - 1 Start\\', and the point count is \\'1\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the map for adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as a waypoint.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[947,99],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Options\\' button, located at the bottom left of the screen (center approximately at [947, 99], with text \\'Options\\' and bounding box [937, 35, 958, 164]). This action is predicted to open a menu with further options, including \\'Add as new point\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action was tapping the \\'Options\\' button (located at the bottom left, text \\'Options\\'). This action successfully opened a pop-up menu titled \\'Options\\', which is now displayed on the screen. This menu contains various actions related to the route or track. However, the anticipated option \\'Add as new point\\' is not available in this menu. While the action of opening the menu was successful, it did not lead to the expected path for adding the waypoint. The plan needs to be revised to close this menu and attempt adding the waypoint using the \\'Add\\' button on the main map screen.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[941,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close\\' button, located at the bottom of the \\'Options\\' menu (center approximately at [941, 501], with text \\'Close\\' and bounding box [934, 455, 949, 547]). This action is predicted to close the \\'Options\\' menu and return to the map view, which should still be centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Close\\' button (located at approximately [941, 501]) was successful. The \\'Options\\' menu, which was visible in the first screenshot, is now closed, and the screen has returned to the map view, as shown in the second screenshot. The map is centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (which should be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Add\\' button, located at approximately [945, 865]. The screen title was \\'Plan a route\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was the only waypoint listed, with a point count of 1. The intended outcome was to add the currently centered location (expected to be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' from the previous search in step 15 and \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' in step 16) as the second waypoint. However, the action had no discernible effect on the UI. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint visible. The action failed to add the waypoint and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[147,175],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at approximately [147, 175]. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open the search interface, allowing for the input of \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the search icon at [147, 175]. Before the action, the screen was in the \\'Plan a route\\' map view. After the action, the screen changed to display search results for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The title is \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button is visible. This action was successful in opening the search interface and, unexpectedly, it pre-filled or recalled the previous search for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step in the plan is to tap \\'SHOW ON MAP\\'.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is associated with \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The button has text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' and is located at approximately [142, 248]. This action is predicted to center the map on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' and prepare it for being added as a waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' at [142, 248] was successful. The screen changed from the search results for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and the title at the top of the screen confirms this. The list of waypoints still shows \\'Point - 1 Start\\', and the point count is \\'1\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the map for adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as a waypoint.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[947,99],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Options\\' button, located at the bottom left of the screen (center approximately at [947, 99], with text \\'Options\\' and bounding box [937, 35, 958, 164]). This action is predicted to open a menu with further options, including \\'Add as new point\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action was tapping the \\'Options\\' button (located at the bottom left, text \\'Options\\'). This action successfully opened a pop-up menu titled \\'Options\\', which is now displayed on the screen. This menu contains various actions related to the route or track. However, the anticipated option \\'Add as new point\\' is not available in this menu. While the action of opening the menu was successful, it did not lead to the expected path for adding the waypoint. The plan needs to be revised to close this menu and attempt adding the waypoint using the \\'Add\\' button on the main map screen.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[941,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close\\' button, located at the bottom of the \\'Options\\' menu (center approximately at [941, 501], with text \\'Close\\' and bounding box [934, 455, 949, 547]). This action is predicted to close the \\'Options\\' menu and return to the map view, which should still be centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Close\\' button (located at approximately [941, 501]) was successful. The \\'Options\\' menu, which was visible in the first screenshot, is now closed, and the screen has returned to the map view, as shown in the second screenshot. The map is centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the next planned step, which is to tap the \\'Add\\' button.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 23: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (\\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2, and \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' should appear as \\'Point - 2\\' in the list. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open OsmAnd app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The OsmAnd app\\'s main screen is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled down, and tapped on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
        "response": "{'ScreenshotDifferenceObservation': \"The title at the top of the screen changed from 'Triesen, Liechtenstein' (visible in the first screenshot) to 'Plan a route' (visible in the second screenshot). The 'X' icon that was likely next to 'Triesen, Liechtenstein' is gone, and a standard back arrow is now next to 'Plan a route'. The list of waypoints ('Point - 1 Start') and the point count ('0 ft, points: 1') remain unchanged. The main map area appears visually similar.\", 'StepByStepExplanation': \"The last action was tapping the 'Add' button, aiming to add 'Triesen, Liechtenstein' as the second waypoint. At the time of the tap, the map was centered on Triesen (from Step 20), and the screen title was 'Triesen, Liechtenstein'. The tap did not result in a new waypoint being added; the point count remained 1. The primary observed effect was the change of the screen title to 'Plan a route'. This behavior, also seen in a previous attempt (Step 18), suggests that the 'Add' button's function is context-dependent. When the app is displaying a specific location found via search (indicated by the location name as the title), tapping 'Add' seems to exit this specific view and return to the general 'Plan a route' screen without adding the point.\\nThe current hypothesis is that for the 'Add' button to successfully add a new waypoint, the app must be in the general 'Plan a route' state (i.e., title is 'Plan a route'). Since the last action inadvertently achieved this state, and assuming the map is still centered on 'Triesen, Liechtenstein', the next logical step is to tap the 'Add' button again. If this adds a 'Point - 2', we will then verify it corresponds to Triesen. If it adds a generic point, we may need to re-search Triesen and use 'SHOW ON MAP' to assign it to 'Point - 2', similar to how 'Point - 1' was defined.\", 'ActionOutcomeDescription': \"The action was to tap the 'Add' button at [945, 865].

The intended outcome was to add 'Triesen, Liechtenstein' as the second waypoint. However, the action did not add a new waypoint. The point count remained '1', and 'Point - 1 Start' was still the only waypoint listed. Instead of adding a point, the action changed the screen title from 'Triesen, Liechtenstein' to 'Plan a route'. This suggests that tapping 'Add' while the UI is in a specific location view (indicated by the location name as the title) dismisses that view rather than adding the point. The action failed to directly add the waypoint.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[147,175],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at approximately [147, 175]. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open the search interface, allowing for the input of \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the search icon at [147, 175]. Before the action, the screen was in the \\'Plan a route\\' map view. After the action, the screen changed to display search results for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The title is \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button is visible. This action was successful in opening the search interface and, unexpectedly, it pre-filled or recalled the previous search for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step in the plan is to tap \\'SHOW ON MAP\\'.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is associated with \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The button has text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' and is located at approximately [142, 248]. This action is predicted to center the map on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' and prepare it for being added as a waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' at [142, 248] was successful. The screen changed from the search results for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and the title at the top of the screen confirms this. The list of waypoints still shows \\'Point - 1 Start\\', and the point count is \\'1\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the map for adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as a waypoint.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[947,99],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Options\\' button, located at the bottom left of the screen (center approximately at [947, 99], with text \\'Options\\' and bounding box [937, 35, 958, 164]). This action is predicted to open a menu with further options, including \\'Add as new point\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action was tapping the \\'Options\\' button (located at the bottom left, text \\'Options\\'). This action successfully opened a pop-up menu titled \\'Options\\', which is now displayed on the screen. This menu contains various actions related to the route or track. However, the anticipated option \\'Add as new point\\' is not available in this menu. While the action of opening the menu was successful, it did not lead to the expected path for adding the waypoint. The plan needs to be revised to close this menu and attempt adding the waypoint using the \\'Add\\' button on the main map screen.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[941,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close\\' button, located at the bottom of the \\'Options\\' menu (center approximately at [941, 501], with text \\'Close\\' and bounding box [934, 455, 949, 547]). This action is predicted to close the \\'Options\\' menu and return to the map view, which should still be centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Close\\' button (located at approximately [941, 501]) was successful. The \\'Options\\' menu, which was visible in the first screenshot, is now closed, and the screen has returned to the map view, as shown in the second screenshot. The map is centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the next planned step, which is to tap the \\'Add\\' button.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (\\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2, and \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' should appear as \\'Point - 2\\' in the list. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 865]. Before this action, the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' (as a result of a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' action in Step 20), and the screen title was \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The intended outcome was to add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. However, the action did not add a new waypoint. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint listed. Instead of adding a point, the action changed the screen title from \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' to \\'Plan a route\\'. This suggests that tapping \\'Add\\' while the UI is in a specific location view (indicated by the location name as the title) dismisses that view rather than adding the point. The action failed to directly add the waypoint. However, by changing the title to \\'Plan a route\\', it may have inadvertently set up the correct context for the \\'Add\\' button to function as intended on a subsequent tap, assuming the map remains centered on Triesen.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[147,175],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at approximately [147, 175]. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open the search interface, allowing for the input of \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the search icon at [147, 175]. Before the action, the screen was in the \\'Plan a route\\' map view. After the action, the screen changed to display search results for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The title is \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button is visible. This action was successful in opening the search interface and, unexpectedly, it pre-filled or recalled the previous search for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step in the plan is to tap \\'SHOW ON MAP\\'.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is associated with \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The button has text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' and is located at approximately [142, 248]. This action is predicted to center the map on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' and prepare it for being added as a waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' at [142, 248] was successful. The screen changed from the search results for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and the title at the top of the screen confirms this. The list of waypoints still shows \\'Point - 1 Start\\', and the point count is \\'1\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the map for adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as a waypoint.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[947,99],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Options\\' button, located at the bottom left of the screen (center approximately at [947, 99], with text \\'Options\\' and bounding box [937, 35, 958, 164]). This action is predicted to open a menu with further options, including \\'Add as new point\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action was tapping the \\'Options\\' button (located at the bottom left, text \\'Options\\'). This action successfully opened a pop-up menu titled \\'Options\\', which is now displayed on the screen. This menu contains various actions related to the route or track. However, the anticipated option \\'Add as new point\\' is not available in this menu. While the action of opening the menu was successful, it did not lead to the expected path for adding the waypoint. The plan needs to be revised to close this menu and attempt adding the waypoint using the \\'Add\\' button on the main map screen.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[941,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close\\' button, located at the bottom of the \\'Options\\' menu (center approximately at [941, 501], with text \\'Close\\' and bounding box [934, 455, 949, 547]). This action is predicted to close the \\'Options\\' menu and return to the map view, which should still be centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Close\\' button (located at approximately [941, 501]) was successful. The \\'Options\\' menu, which was visible in the first screenshot, is now closed, and the screen has returned to the map view, as shown in the second screenshot. The map is centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the next planned step, which is to tap the \\'Add\\' button.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (\\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2, and \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' should appear as \\'Point - 2\\' in the list. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 865]. Before this action, the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' (as a result of a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' action in Step 20), and the screen title was \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The intended outcome was to add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. However, the action did not add a new waypoint. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint listed. Instead of adding a point, the action changed the screen title from \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' to \\'Plan a route\\'. This suggests that tapping \\'Add\\' while the UI is in a specific location view (indicated by the location name as the title) dismisses that view rather than adding the point. The action failed to directly add the waypoint. However, by changing the title to \\'Plan a route\\', it may have inadvertently set up the correct context for the \\'Add\\' button to function as intended on a subsequent tap, assuming the map remains centered on Triesen.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 24: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center approximately at [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (presumably \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint. The point count should increase to 2, and a \\'Point - 2\\' should appear in the list. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open OsmAnd app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The OsmAnd app\\'s main screen is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled down, and tapped on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

The button has text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' and is located at approximately [142, 248]. This action is predicted to center the map on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' and prepare it for being added as a waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' at [142, 248] was successful. The screen changed from the search results for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and the title at the top of the screen confirms this. The list of waypoints still shows \\'Point - 1 Start\\', and the point count is \\'1\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the map for adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as a waypoint.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[947,99],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Options\\' button, located at the bottom left of the screen (center approximately at [947, 99], with text \\'Options\\' and bounding box [937, 35, 958, 164]). This action is predicted to open a menu with further options, including \\'Add as new point\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action was tapping the \\'Options\\' button (located at the bottom left, text \\'Options\\'). This action successfully opened a pop-up menu titled \\'Options\\', which is now displayed on the screen. This menu contains various actions related to the route or track. However, the anticipated option \\'Add as new point\\' is not available in this menu. While the action of opening the menu was successful, it did not lead to the expected path for adding the waypoint. The plan needs to be revised to close this menu and attempt adding the waypoint using the \\'Add\\' button on the main map screen.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[941,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close\\' button, located at the bottom of the \\'Options\\' menu (center approximately at [941, 501], with text \\'Close\\' and bounding box [934, 455, 949, 547]). This action is predicted to close the \\'Options\\' menu and return to the map view, which should still be centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Close\\' button (located at approximately [941, 501]) was successful. The \\'Options\\' menu, which was visible in the first screenshot, is now closed, and the screen has returned to the map view, as shown in the second screenshot. The map is centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the next planned step, which is to tap the \\'Add\\' button.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (\\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2, and \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' should appear as \\'Point - 2\\' in the list. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 865]. Before this action, the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' (as a result of a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' action in Step 20), and the screen title was \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The intended outcome was to add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. However, the action did not add a new waypoint. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint listed. Instead of adding a point, the action changed the screen title from \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' to \\'Plan a route\\'. This suggests that tapping \\'Add\\' while the UI is in a specific location view (indicated by the location name as the title) dismisses that view rather than adding the point. The action failed to directly add the waypoint. However, by changing the title to \\'Plan a route\\', it may have inadvertently set up the correct context for the \\'Add\\' button to function as intended on a subsequent tap, assuming the map remains centered on Triesen.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center approximately at [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (presumably \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint. The point count should increase to 2, and a \\'Point - 2\\' should appear in the list. Actual Outcome: The last action was tapping the \\'Add\\' button at approximately [945, 865]. Before this action, the screen title was \\'Plan a route\\', the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and one waypoint (\\'Point - 1 Start\\') was listed. The intended outcome was to add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. However, the action resulted in no visible change on the screen. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint listed. The action failed to add the waypoint, as the \\'Add\\' button did not function as expected in this state.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,248],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is associated with \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The button has text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' and is located at approximately [142, 248]. This action is predicted to center the map on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' and prepare it for being added as a waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' at [142, 248] was successful. The screen changed from the search results for \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and the title at the top of the screen confirms this. The list of waypoints still shows \\'Point - 1 Start\\', and the point count is \\'1\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the map for adding \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as a waypoint.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[947,99],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Options\\' button, located at the bottom left of the screen (center approximately at [947, 99], with text \\'Options\\' and bounding box [937, 35, 958, 164]). This action is predicted to open a menu with further options, including \\'Add as new point\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action was tapping the \\'Options\\' button (located at the bottom left, text \\'Options\\'). This action successfully opened a pop-up menu titled \\'Options\\', which is now displayed on the screen. This menu contains various actions related to the route or track. However, the anticipated option \\'Add as new point\\' is not available in this menu. While the action of opening the menu was successful, it did not lead to the expected path for adding the waypoint. The plan needs to be revised to close this menu and attempt adding the waypoint using the \\'Add\\' button on the main map screen.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[941,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close\\' button, located at the bottom of the \\'Options\\' menu (center approximately at [941, 501], with text \\'Close\\' and bounding box [934, 455, 949, 547]). This action is predicted to close the \\'Options\\' menu and return to the map view, which should still be centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Close\\' button (located at approximately [941, 501]) was successful. The \\'Options\\' menu, which was visible in the first screenshot, is now closed, and the screen has returned to the map view, as shown in the second screenshot. The map is centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the next planned step, which is to tap the \\'Add\\' button.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (\\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2, and \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' should appear as \\'Point - 2\\' in the list. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 865]. Before this action, the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' (as a result of a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' action in Step 20), and the screen title was \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The intended outcome was to add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. However, the action did not add a new waypoint. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint listed. Instead of adding a point, the action changed the screen title from \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' to \\'Plan a route\\'. This suggests that tapping \\'Add\\' while the UI is in a specific location view (indicated by the location name as the title) dismisses that view rather than adding the point. The action failed to directly add the waypoint. However, by changing the title to \\'Plan a route\\', it may have inadvertently set up the correct context for the \\'Add\\' button to function as intended on a subsequent tap, assuming the map remains centered on Triesen.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center approximately at [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (presumably \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint. The point count should increase to 2, and a \\'Point - 2\\' should appear in the list. Actual Outcome: The last action was tapping the \\'Add\\' button at approximately [945, 865]. Before this action, the screen title was \\'Plan a route\\', the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and one waypoint (\\'Point - 1 Start\\') was listed. The intended outcome was to add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. However, the action resulted in no visible change on the screen. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint listed. The action failed to add the waypoint, as the \\'Add\\' button did not function as expected in this state.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 25: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the map at the current center, indicated by a blue circle marker at approximately [240, 495]. This location is presumed to be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action is an attempt to explicitly select the location on the map before trying to add it as a waypoint. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open OsmAnd app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The OsmAnd app\\'s main screen is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled down, and tapped on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[947,99],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Options\\' button, located at the bottom left of the screen (center approximately at [947, 99], with text \\'Options\\' and bounding box [937, 35, 958, 164]). This action is predicted to open a menu with further options, including \\'Add as new point\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action was tapping the \\'Options\\' button (located at the bottom left, text \\'Options\\'). This action successfully opened a pop-up menu titled \\'Options\\', which is now displayed on the screen. This menu contains various actions related to the route or track. However, the anticipated option \\'Add as new point\\' is not available in this menu. While the action of opening the menu was successful, it did not lead to the expected path for adding the waypoint. The plan needs to be revised to close this menu and attempt adding the waypoint using the \\'Add\\' button on the main map screen.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[941,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close\\' button, located at the bottom of the \\'Options\\' menu (center approximately at [941, 501], with text \\'Close\\' and bounding box [934, 455, 949, 547]). This action is predicted to close the \\'Options\\' menu and return to the map view, which should still be centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Close\\' button (located at approximately [941, 501]) was successful. The \\'Options\\' menu, which was visible in the first screenshot, is now closed, and the screen has returned to the map view, as shown in the second screenshot. The map is centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the next planned step, which is to tap the \\'Add\\' button.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (\\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2, and \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' should appear as \\'Point - 2\\' in the list. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 865]. Before this action, the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' (as a result of a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' action in Step 20), and the screen title was \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The intended outcome was to add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. However, the action did not add a new waypoint. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint listed. Instead of adding a point, the action changed the screen title from \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' to \\'Plan a route\\'. This suggests that tapping \\'Add\\' while the UI is in a specific location view (indicated by the location name as the title) dismisses that view rather than adding the point. The action failed to directly add the waypoint. However, by changing the title to \\'Plan a route\\', it may have inadvertently set up the correct context for the \\'Add\\' button to function as intended on a subsequent tap, assuming the map remains centered on Triesen.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center approximately at [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (presumably \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint. The point count should increase to 2, and a \\'Point - 2\\' should appear in the list. Actual Outcome: The last action was tapping the \\'Add\\' button at approximately [945, 865]. Before this action, the screen title was \\'Plan a route\\', the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and one waypoint (\\'Point - 1 Start\\') was listed. The intended outcome was to add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. However, the action resulted in no visible change on the screen. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint listed. The action failed to add the waypoint, as the \\'Add\\' button did not function as expected in this state.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the map at the current center, indicated by a blue circle marker at approximately [240, 495]. This location is presumed to be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action is an attempt to explicitly select the location on the map before trying to add it as a waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the map at [240, 495] was successful. Before this action, there was one waypoint (\\'Point - 1 Start\\') and the point count was 1. After the action, a second waypoint (\\'Point - 2\\') was added to the list, and the point count updated to 2 (displayed as \\'11.6 mi, points: 2\\'). Since the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' when the tap occurred, it is assumed that \\'Point - 2\\' corresponds to \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action successfully completed the objective of adding the second waypoint.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[947,99],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Options\\' button, located at the bottom left of the screen (center approximately at [947, 99], with text \\'Options\\' and bounding box [937, 35, 958, 164]). This action is predicted to open a menu with further options, including \\'Add as new point\\'. Actual Outcome: The last action was tapping the \\'Options\\' button (located at the bottom left, text \\'Options\\'). This action successfully opened a pop-up menu titled \\'Options\\', which is now displayed on the screen. This menu contains various actions related to the route or track. However, the anticipated option \\'Add as new point\\' is not available in this menu. While the action of opening the menu was successful, it did not lead to the expected path for adding the waypoint. The plan needs to be revised to close this menu and attempt adding the waypoint using the \\'Add\\' button on the main map screen.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[941,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close\\' button, located at the bottom of the \\'Options\\' menu (center approximately at [941, 501], with text \\'Close\\' and bounding box [934, 455, 949, 547]). This action is predicted to close the \\'Options\\' menu and return to the map view, which should still be centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Close\\' button (located at approximately [941, 501]) was successful. The \\'Options\\' menu, which was visible in the first screenshot, is now closed, and the screen has returned to the map view, as shown in the second screenshot. The map is centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the next planned step, which is to tap the \\'Add\\' button.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (\\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2, and \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' should appear as \\'Point - 2\\' in the list. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 865]. Before this action, the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' (as a result of a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' action in Step 20), and the screen title was \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The intended outcome was to add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. However, the action did not add a new waypoint. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint listed. Instead of adding a point, the action changed the screen title from \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' to \\'Plan a route\\'. This suggests that tapping \\'Add\\' while the UI is in a specific location view (indicated by the location name as the title) dismisses that view rather than adding the point. The action failed to directly add the waypoint. However, by changing the title to \\'Plan a route\\', it may have inadvertently set up the correct context for the \\'Add\\' button to function as intended on a subsequent tap, assuming the map remains centered on Triesen.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center approximately at [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (presumably \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint. The point count should increase to 2, and a \\'Point - 2\\' should appear in the list. Actual Outcome: The last action was tapping the \\'Add\\' button at approximately [945, 865]. Before this action, the screen title was \\'Plan a route\\', the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and one waypoint (\\'Point - 1 Start\\') was listed. The intended outcome was to add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. However, the action resulted in no visible change on the screen. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint listed. The action failed to add the waypoint, as the \\'Add\\' button did not function as expected in this state.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the map at the current center, indicated by a blue circle marker at approximately [240, 495]. This location is presumed to be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action is an attempt to explicitly select the location on the map before trying to add it as a waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the map at [240, 495] was successful. Before this action, there was one waypoint (\\'Point - 1 Start\\') and the point count was 1. After the action, a second waypoint (\\'Point - 2\\') was added to the list, and the point count updated to 2 (displayed as \\'11.6 mi, points: 2\\'). Since the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' when the tap occurred, it is assumed that \\'Point - 2\\' corresponds to \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action successfully completed the objective of adding the second waypoint.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 26: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[146,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top left of the screen, with an approximate center at [146, 186] (within bounding box [120, 129, 172, 244]). This action is predicted to open the search interface, allowing me to input the name of the next waypoint.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to close the \\'Options\\' menu and return to the map view, which should still be centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Close\\' button (located at approximately [941, 501]) was successful. The \\'Options\\' menu, which was visible in the first screenshot, is now closed, and the screen has returned to the map view, as shown in the second screenshot. The map is centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the next planned step, which is to tap the \\'Add\\' button.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (\\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2, and \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' should appear as \\'Point - 2\\' in the list. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 865]. Before this action, the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' (as a result of a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' action in Step 20), and the screen title was \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The intended outcome was to add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. However, the action did not add a new waypoint. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint listed. Instead of adding a point, the action changed the screen title from \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' to \\'Plan a route\\'. This suggests that tapping \\'Add\\' while the UI is in a specific location view (indicated by the location name as the title) dismisses that view rather than adding the point. The action failed to directly add the waypoint. However, by changing the title to \\'Plan a route\\', it may have inadvertently set up the correct context for the \\'Add\\' button to function as intended on a subsequent tap, assuming the map remains centered on Triesen.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center approximately at [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (presumably \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint. The point count should increase to 2, and a \\'Point - 2\\' should appear in the list. Actual Outcome: The last action was tapping the \\'Add\\' button at approximately [945, 865]. Before this action, the screen title was \\'Plan a route\\', the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and one waypoint (\\'Point - 1 Start\\') was listed. The intended outcome was to add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. However, the action resulted in no visible change on the screen. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint listed. The action failed to add the waypoint, as the \\'Add\\' button did not function as expected in this state.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the map at the current center, indicated by a blue circle marker at approximately [240, 495]. This location is presumed to be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action is an attempt to explicitly select the location on the map before trying to add it as a waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the map at [240, 495] was successful. Before this action, there was one waypoint (\\'Point - 1 Start\\') and the point count was 1. After the action, a second waypoint (\\'Point - 2\\') was added to the list, and the point count updated to 2 (displayed as \\'11.6 mi, points: 2\\'). Since the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' when the tap occurred, it is assumed that \\'Point - 2\\' corresponds to \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action successfully completed the objective of adding the second waypoint.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[146,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top left of the screen, with an approximate center at [146, 186] (within bounding box [120, 129, 172, 244]). This action is predicted to open the search interface, allowing me to input the name of the next waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the search icon at [146, 186] (first screenshot) resulted in the screen changing to a view titled \"Triesen, Liechtenstein\" (second screenshot). This screen displays information about \"Triesen, Liechtenstein\" and options like \"SHOW ON MAP\" and \"INCREASE SEARCH RADIUS\". This is not a generic search input screen. The action did not bring the agent closer to inputting \"Bendern, Liechtenstein\" because it seems to have reopened the context of the previous search. The action was partially successful in that it opened *a* search-related screen, but unsuccessful in providing a clear path to search for a *new* location. To correct this, we need to navigate away from this specific search result screen, likely by using the back arrow.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[941,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close\\' button, located at the bottom of the \\'Options\\' menu (center approximately at [941, 501], with text \\'Close\\' and bounding box [934, 455, 949, 547]). This action is predicted to close the \\'Options\\' menu and return to the map view, which should still be centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Close\\' button (located at approximately [941, 501]) was successful. The \\'Options\\' menu, which was visible in the first screenshot, is now closed, and the screen has returned to the map view, as shown in the second screenshot. The map is centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the next planned step, which is to tap the \\'Add\\' button.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (\\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2, and \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' should appear as \\'Point - 2\\' in the list. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 865]. Before this action, the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' (as a result of a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' action in Step 20), and the screen title was \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The intended outcome was to add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. However, the action did not add a new waypoint. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint listed. Instead of adding a point, the action changed the screen title from \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' to \\'Plan a route\\'. This suggests that tapping \\'Add\\' while the UI is in a specific location view (indicated by the location name as the title) dismisses that view rather than adding the point. The action failed to directly add the waypoint. However, by changing the title to \\'Plan a route\\', it may have inadvertently set up the correct context for the \\'Add\\' button to function as intended on a subsequent tap, assuming the map remains centered on Triesen.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center approximately at [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (presumably \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint. The point count should increase to 2, and a \\'Point - 2\\' should appear in the list. Actual Outcome: The last action was tapping the \\'Add\\' button at approximately [945, 865]. Before this action, the screen title was \\'Plan a route\\', the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and one waypoint (\\'Point - 1 Start\\') was listed. The intended outcome was to add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. However, the action resulted in no visible change on the screen. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint listed. The action failed to add the waypoint, as the \\'Add\\' button did not function as expected in this state.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the map at the current center, indicated by a blue circle marker at approximately [240, 495]. This location is presumed to be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action is an attempt to explicitly select the location on the map before trying to add it as a waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the map at [240, 495] was successful. Before this action, there was one waypoint (\\'Point - 1 Start\\') and the point count was 1. After the action, a second waypoint (\\'Point - 2\\') was added to the list, and the point count updated to 2 (displayed as \\'11.6 mi, points: 2\\'). Since the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' when the tap occurred, it is assumed that \\'Point - 2\\' corresponds to \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action successfully completed the objective of adding the second waypoint.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[146,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top left of the screen, with an approximate center at [146, 186] (within bounding box [120, 129, 172, 244]). This action is predicted to open the search interface, allowing me to input the name of the next waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the search icon at [146, 186] (first screenshot) resulted in the screen changing to a view titled \"Triesen, Liechtenstein\" (second screenshot). This screen displays information about \"Triesen, Liechtenstein\" and options like \"SHOW ON MAP\" and \"INCREASE SEARCH RADIUS\". This is not a generic search input screen. The action did not bring the agent closer to inputting \"Bendern, Liechtenstein\" because it seems to have reopened the context of the previous search. The action was partially successful in that it opened *a* search-related screen, but unsuccessful in providing a clear path to search for a *new* location. To correct this, we need to navigate away from this specific search result screen, likely by using the back arrow.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 27: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the title \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' (approximately at [85, 65]). This action is predicted to navigate to the previous screen, which should be the route planning screen or a search interface, allowing me to search for \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open OsmAnd app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The OsmAnd app\\'s main screen is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled down, and tapped on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (\\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2, and \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' should appear as \\'Point - 2\\' in the list. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 865]. Before this action, the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' (as a result of a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' action in Step 20), and the screen title was \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The intended outcome was to add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. However, the action did not add a new waypoint. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint listed. Instead of adding a point, the action changed the screen title from \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' to \\'Plan a route\\'. This suggests that tapping \\'Add\\' while the UI is in a specific location view (indicated by the location name as the title) dismisses that view rather than adding the point. The action failed to directly add the waypoint. However, by changing the title to \\'Plan a route\\', it may have inadvertently set up the correct context for the \\'Add\\' button to function as intended on a subsequent tap, assuming the map remains centered on Triesen.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center approximately at [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (presumably \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint. The point count should increase to 2, and a \\'Point - 2\\' should appear in the list. Actual Outcome: The last action was tapping the \\'Add\\' button at approximately [945, 865]. Before this action, the screen title was \\'Plan a route\\', the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and one waypoint (\\'Point - 1 Start\\') was listed. The intended outcome was to add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. However, the action resulted in no visible change on the screen. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint listed. The action failed to add the waypoint, as the \\'Add\\' button did not function as expected in this state.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the map at the current center, indicated by a blue circle marker at approximately [240, 495]. This location is presumed to be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action is an attempt to explicitly select the location on the map before trying to add it as a waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the map at [240, 495] was successful. Before this action, there was one waypoint (\\'Point - 1 Start\\') and the point count was 1. After the action, a second waypoint (\\'Point - 2\\') was added to the list, and the point count updated to 2 (displayed as \\'11.6 mi, points: 2\\'). Since the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' when the tap occurred, it is assumed that \\'Point - 2\\' corresponds to \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action successfully completed the objective of adding the second waypoint.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[146,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top left of the screen, with an approximate center at [146, 186] (within bounding box [120, 129, 172, 244]). This action is predicted to open the search interface, allowing me to input the name of the next waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the search icon at [146, 186] (first screenshot) resulted in the screen changing to a view titled \"Triesen, Liechtenstein\" (second screenshot). This screen displays information about \"Triesen, Liechtenstein\" and options like \"SHOW ON MAP\" and \"INCREASE SEARCH RADIUS\". This is not a generic search input screen. The action did not bring the agent closer to inputting \"Bendern, Liechtenstein\" because it seems to have reopened the context of the previous search. The action was partially successful in that it opened *a* search-related screen, but unsuccessful in providing a clear path to search for a *new* location. To correct this, we need to navigate away from this specific search result screen, likely by using the back arrow.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the title \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' (approximately at [85, 65]). This action is predicted to navigate to the previous screen, which should be the route planning screen or a search interface, allowing me to search for \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (located at approximately [85, 65] in the first screenshot) was successful. The screen changed from the \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' details view to a search interface. The new screen has a placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\' (bounding box approximately [74, 170, 100, 519]) and tabs for \\'HISTORY\\', \\'CATEGORIES\\', and \\'ADDRESS\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the necessary interface to search for the next waypoint, \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.56\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 170, 100, 519], \\'text\\': \\'Type to search all\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 87, 151, 250], \\'text\\': \\'HISTORY\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 385, 150, 619], \\'text\\': \\'CATEGORIES\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 748, 150, 921], \\'text\\': \\'ADDRESS\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [115, 0, 170, 333]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [115, 333, 169, 680]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [115, 682, 169, 994]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 42, 41, 244]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 362, 1000, 633]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 166, 100, 525]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center at approximately [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (\\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint in the route plan. The point count should increase to 2, and \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' should appear as \\'Point - 2\\' in the list. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap the \\'Add\\' button at [945, 865]. Before this action, the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' (as a result of a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' action in Step 20), and the screen title was \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. The intended outcome was to add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. However, the action did not add a new waypoint. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint listed. Instead of adding a point, the action changed the screen title from \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' to \\'Plan a route\\'. This suggests that tapping \\'Add\\' while the UI is in a specific location view (indicated by the location name as the title) dismisses that view rather than adding the point. The action failed to directly add the waypoint. However, by changing the title to \\'Plan a route\\', it may have inadvertently set up the correct context for the \\'Add\\' button to function as intended on a subsequent tap, assuming the map remains centered on Triesen.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center approximately at [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (presumably \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint. The point count should increase to 2, and a \\'Point - 2\\' should appear in the list. Actual Outcome: The last action was tapping the \\'Add\\' button at approximately [945, 865]. Before this action, the screen title was \\'Plan a route\\', the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and one waypoint (\\'Point - 1 Start\\') was listed. The intended outcome was to add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. However, the action resulted in no visible change on the screen. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint listed. The action failed to add the waypoint, as the \\'Add\\' button did not function as expected in this state.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the map at the current center, indicated by a blue circle marker at approximately [240, 495]. This location is presumed to be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action is an attempt to explicitly select the location on the map before trying to add it as a waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the map at [240, 495] was successful. Before this action, there was one waypoint (\\'Point - 1 Start\\') and the point count was 1. After the action, a second waypoint (\\'Point - 2\\') was added to the list, and the point count updated to 2 (displayed as \\'11.6 mi, points: 2\\'). Since the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' when the tap occurred, it is assumed that \\'Point - 2\\' corresponds to \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action successfully completed the objective of adding the second waypoint.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[146,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top left of the screen, with an approximate center at [146, 186] (within bounding box [120, 129, 172, 244]). This action is predicted to open the search interface, allowing me to input the name of the next waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the search icon at [146, 186] (first screenshot) resulted in the screen changing to a view titled \"Triesen, Liechtenstein\" (second screenshot). This screen displays information about \"Triesen, Liechtenstein\" and options like \"SHOW ON MAP\" and \"INCREASE SEARCH RADIUS\". This is not a generic search input screen. The action did not bring the agent closer to inputting \"Bendern, Liechtenstein\" because it seems to have reopened the context of the previous search. The action was partially successful in that it opened *a* search-related screen, but unsuccessful in providing a clear path to search for a *new* location. To correct this, we need to navigate away from this specific search result screen, likely by using the back arrow.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the title \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' (approximately at [85, 65]). This action is predicted to navigate to the previous screen, which should be the route planning screen or a search interface, allowing me to search for \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (located at approximately [85, 65] in the first screenshot) was successful. The screen changed from the \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' details view to a search interface. The new screen has a placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\' (bounding box approximately [74, 170, 100, 519]) and tabs for \\'HISTORY\\', \\'CATEGORIES\\', and \\'ADDRESS\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the necessary interface to search for the next waypoint, \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 28: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,344],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field labeled \\'Type to search all\\' (center approximately at [87, 344], within bounding box [74, 170, 100, 519]). This action is predicted to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open OsmAnd app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The OsmAnd app\\'s main screen is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled down, and tapped on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center approximately at [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (presumably \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint. The point count should increase to 2, and a \\'Point - 2\\' should appear in the list. Actual Outcome: The last action was tapping the \\'Add\\' button at approximately [945, 865]. Before this action, the screen title was \\'Plan a route\\', the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and one waypoint (\\'Point - 1 Start\\') was listed. The intended outcome was to add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. However, the action resulted in no visible change on the screen. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint listed. The action failed to add the waypoint, as the \\'Add\\' button did not function as expected in this state.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the map at the current center, indicated by a blue circle marker at approximately [240, 495]. This location is presumed to be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action is an attempt to explicitly select the location on the map before trying to add it as a waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the map at [240, 495] was successful. Before this action, there was one waypoint (\\'Point - 1 Start\\') and the point count was 1. After the action, a second waypoint (\\'Point - 2\\') was added to the list, and the point count updated to 2 (displayed as \\'11.6 mi, points: 2\\'). Since the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' when the tap occurred, it is assumed that \\'Point - 2\\' corresponds to \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action successfully completed the objective of adding the second waypoint.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[146,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top left of the screen, with an approximate center at [146, 186] (within bounding box [120, 129, 172, 244]). This action is predicted to open the search interface, allowing me to input the name of the next waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the search icon at [146, 186] (first screenshot) resulted in the screen changing to a view titled \"Triesen, Liechtenstein\" (second screenshot). This screen displays information about \"Triesen, Liechtenstein\" and options like \"SHOW ON MAP\" and \"INCREASE SEARCH RADIUS\". This is not a generic search input screen. The action did not bring the agent closer to inputting \"Bendern, Liechtenstein\" because it seems to have reopened the context of the previous search. The action was partially successful in that it opened *a* search-related screen, but unsuccessful in providing a clear path to search for a *new* location. To correct this, we need to navigate away from this specific search result screen, likely by using the back arrow.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the title \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' (approximately at [85, 65]). This action is predicted to navigate to the previous screen, which should be the route planning screen or a search interface, allowing me to search for \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (located at approximately [85, 65] in the first screenshot) was successful. The screen changed from the \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' details view to a search interface. The new screen has a placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\' (bounding box approximately [74, 170, 100, 519]) and tabs for \\'HISTORY\\', \\'CATEGORIES\\', and \\'ADDRESS\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the necessary interface to search for the next waypoint, \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,344],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field labeled \\'Type to search all\\' (center approximately at [87, 344], within bounding box [74, 170, 100, 519]). This action is predicted to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the search field \\'Type to search all\\' (center approximately at [87, 344]) was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. The screen remains on the search interface. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the interface for text input.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 134], \\'text\\': \\'15.57\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 170, 99, 519], \\'text\\': \\'fype to search all\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 87, 151, 250], \\'text\\': \\'HISTORY\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 385, 150, 619], \\'text\\': \\'CATEGORIES\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [134, 748, 150, 921], \\'text\\': \\'ADDRESS\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [115, 0, 170, 333]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [115, 333, 169, 681]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [115, 682, 169, 996]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 42, 40, 243]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 165, 100, 525]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"Type to search all\", resource-id=\"net.osmand:id/searchEditText\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.osmand\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[189,128][1080,275]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Type to search all\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[945,865],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Add\\' button, located at the bottom right of the screen (center approximately at [945, 865], with bounding box [938, 831, 953, 899]). This button is currently visible. This action is predicted to add the currently centered location (presumably \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\') as the second waypoint. The point count should increase to 2, and a \\'Point - 2\\' should appear in the list. Actual Outcome: The last action was tapping the \\'Add\\' button at approximately [945, 865]. Before this action, the screen title was \\'Plan a route\\', the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\', and one waypoint (\\'Point - 1 Start\\') was listed. The intended outcome was to add \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' as the second waypoint. However, the action resulted in no visible change on the screen. The point count remained \\'1\\', and \\'Point - 1 Start\\' was still the only waypoint listed. The action failed to add the waypoint, as the \\'Add\\' button did not function as expected in this state.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the map at the current center, indicated by a blue circle marker at approximately [240, 495]. This location is presumed to be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action is an attempt to explicitly select the location on the map before trying to add it as a waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the map at [240, 495] was successful. Before this action, there was one waypoint (\\'Point - 1 Start\\') and the point count was 1. After the action, a second waypoint (\\'Point - 2\\') was added to the list, and the point count updated to 2 (displayed as \\'11.6 mi, points: 2\\'). Since the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' when the tap occurred, it is assumed that \\'Point - 2\\' corresponds to \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action successfully completed the objective of adding the second waypoint.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[146,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top left of the screen, with an approximate center at [146, 186] (within bounding box [120, 129, 172, 244]). This action is predicted to open the search interface, allowing me to input the name of the next waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the search icon at [146, 186] (first screenshot) resulted in the screen changing to a view titled \"Triesen, Liechtenstein\" (second screenshot). This screen displays information about \"Triesen, Liechtenstein\" and options like \"SHOW ON MAP\" and \"INCREASE SEARCH RADIUS\". This is not a generic search input screen. The action did not bring the agent closer to inputting \"Bendern, Liechtenstein\" because it seems to have reopened the context of the previous search. The action was partially successful in that it opened *a* search-related screen, but unsuccessful in providing a clear path to search for a *new* location. To correct this, we need to navigate away from this specific search result screen, likely by using the back arrow.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the title \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' (approximately at [85, 65]). This action is predicted to navigate to the previous screen, which should be the route planning screen or a search interface, allowing me to search for \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (located at approximately [85, 65] in the first screenshot) was successful. The screen changed from the \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' details view to a search interface. The new screen has a placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\' (bounding box approximately [74, 170, 100, 519]) and tabs for \\'HISTORY\\', \\'CATEGORIES\\', and \\'ADDRESS\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the necessary interface to search for the next waypoint, \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,344],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field labeled \\'Type to search all\\' (center approximately at [87, 344], within bounding box [74, 170, 100, 519]). This action is predicted to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the search field \\'Type to search all\\' (center approximately at [87, 344]) was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. The screen remains on the search interface. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the interface for text input.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 29: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Bendern, Liechtenstein\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' into the focused search field \\'Type to search all\\'. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\'. After this action, the search field is expected to contain \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', and search results should appear below the search field. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open OsmAnd app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The OsmAnd app\\'s main screen is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled down, and tapped on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the map at the current center, indicated by a blue circle marker at approximately [240, 495]. This location is presumed to be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action is an attempt to explicitly select the location on the map before trying to add it as a waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the map at [240, 495] was successful. Before this action, there was one waypoint (\\'Point - 1 Start\\') and the point count was 1. After the action, a second waypoint (\\'Point - 2\\') was added to the list, and the point count updated to 2 (displayed as \\'11.6 mi, points: 2\\'). Since the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' when the tap occurred, it is assumed that \\'Point - 2\\' corresponds to \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action successfully completed the objective of adding the second waypoint.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[146,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top left of the screen, with an approximate center at [146, 186] (within bounding box [120, 129, 172, 244]). This action is predicted to open the search interface, allowing me to input the name of the next waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the search icon at [146, 186] (first screenshot) resulted in the screen changing to a view titled \"Triesen, Liechtenstein\" (second screenshot). This screen displays information about \"Triesen, Liechtenstein\" and options like \"SHOW ON MAP\" and \"INCREASE SEARCH RADIUS\". This is not a generic search input screen. The action did not bring the agent closer to inputting \"Bendern, Liechtenstein\" because it seems to have reopened the context of the previous search. The action was partially successful in that it opened *a* search-related screen, but unsuccessful in providing a clear path to search for a *new* location. To correct this, we need to navigate away from this specific search result screen, likely by using the back arrow.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the title \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' (approximately at [85, 65]). This action is predicted to navigate to the previous screen, which should be the route planning screen or a search interface, allowing me to search for \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (located at approximately [85, 65] in the first screenshot) was successful. The screen changed from the \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' details view to a search interface. The new screen has a placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\' (bounding box approximately [74, 170, 100, 519]) and tabs for \\'HISTORY\\', \\'CATEGORIES\\', and \\'ADDRESS\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the necessary interface to search for the next waypoint, \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,344],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field labeled \\'Type to search all\\' (center approximately at [87, 344], within bounding box [74, 170, 100, 519]). This action is predicted to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the search field \\'Type to search all\\' (center approximately at [87, 344]) was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. The screen remains on the search interface. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the interface for text input.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Bendern, Liechtenstein\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' into the focused search field \\'Type to search all\\'. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\'. After this action, the search field is expected to contain \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', and search results should appear below the search field. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' into the focused search field was successful. The search field now contains the text \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'. As a result of the input, search results have appeared below the search field. The most prominent result is \\'Liechtenstein Country\\', and there is a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the desired location.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 134], \\'text\\': \\'15.57\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 171, 97, 623], \\'text\\': \\'Bendern; Liechtenstein\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [133, 126, 151, 371], \\'text\\': \\'SHOW ON MAP\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [202, 130, 244, 370], \\'text\\': \\'Liechtenstein Country\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [203, 851, 217, 965], \\'text\\': \\'3288 mi\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [274, 314, 288, 689], \\'text\\': \\'INCREASE SEARCH RADIUS\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 38, 42, 246]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 909, 100, 977]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"Bendern, Liechtenstein\", resource-id=\"net.osmand:id/searchEditText\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"net.osmand\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[189,128][954,275]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Bendern, Liechtenstein\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"Bendern, Liechtenstein\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### Screen Information Text After the Action ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the map at the current center, indicated by a blue circle marker at approximately [240, 495]. This location is presumed to be \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action is an attempt to explicitly select the location on the map before trying to add it as a waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the map at [240, 495] was successful. Before this action, there was one waypoint (\\'Point - 1 Start\\') and the point count was 1. After the action, a second waypoint (\\'Point - 2\\') was added to the list, and the point count updated to 2 (displayed as \\'11.6 mi, points: 2\\'). Since the map was centered on \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' when the tap occurred, it is assumed that \\'Point - 2\\' corresponds to \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\'. This action successfully completed the objective of adding the second waypoint.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[146,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top left of the screen, with an approximate center at [146, 186] (within bounding box [120, 129, 172, 244]). This action is predicted to open the search interface, allowing me to input the name of the next waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the search icon at [146, 186] (first screenshot) resulted in the screen changing to a view titled \"Triesen, Liechtenstein\" (second screenshot). This screen displays information about \"Triesen, Liechtenstein\" and options like \"SHOW ON MAP\" and \"INCREASE SEARCH RADIUS\". This is not a generic search input screen. The action did not bring the agent closer to inputting \"Bendern, Liechtenstein\" because it seems to have reopened the context of the previous search. The action was partially successful in that it opened *a* search-related screen, but unsuccessful in providing a clear path to search for a *new* location. To correct this, we need to navigate away from this specific search result screen, likely by using the back arrow.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the title \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' (approximately at [85, 65]). This action is predicted to navigate to the previous screen, which should be the route planning screen or a search interface, allowing me to search for \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (located at approximately [85, 65] in the first screenshot) was successful. The screen changed from the \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' details view to a search interface. The new screen has a placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\' (bounding box approximately [74, 170, 100, 519]) and tabs for \\'HISTORY\\', \\'CATEGORIES\\', and \\'ADDRESS\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the necessary interface to search for the next waypoint, \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,344],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field labeled \\'Type to search all\\' (center approximately at [87, 344], within bounding box [74, 170, 100, 519]). This action is predicted to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the search field \\'Type to search all\\' (center approximately at [87, 344]) was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. The screen remains on the search interface. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the interface for text input.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Bendern, Liechtenstein\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' into the focused search field \\'Type to search all\\'. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\'. After this action, the search field is expected to contain \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', and search results should appear below the search field. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' into the focused search field was successful. The search field now contains the text \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'. As a result of the input, search results have appeared below the search field. The most prominent result is \\'Liechtenstein Country\\', and there is a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the desired location.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 30: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is located below the search bar and has the text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' (bounding box [133, 126, 151, 371]). The center of this text is approximately [142, 249]. This action is predicted to center the map on \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', preparing it to be added as the next waypoint. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open OsmAnd app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The OsmAnd app\\'s main screen is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled down, and tapped on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[146,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top left of the screen, with an approximate center at [146, 186] (within bounding box [120, 129, 172, 244]). This action is predicted to open the search interface, allowing me to input the name of the next waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the search icon at [146, 186] (first screenshot) resulted in the screen changing to a view titled \"Triesen, Liechtenstein\" (second screenshot). This screen displays information about \"Triesen, Liechtenstein\" and options like \"SHOW ON MAP\" and \"INCREASE SEARCH RADIUS\". This is not a generic search input screen. The action did not bring the agent closer to inputting \"Bendern, Liechtenstein\" because it seems to have reopened the context of the previous search. The action was partially successful in that it opened *a* search-related screen, but unsuccessful in providing a clear path to search for a *new* location. To correct this, we need to navigate away from this specific search result screen, likely by using the back arrow.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the title \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' (approximately at [85, 65]). This action is predicted to navigate to the previous screen, which should be the route planning screen or a search interface, allowing me to search for \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (located at approximately [85, 65] in the first screenshot) was successful. The screen changed from the \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' details view to a search interface. The new screen has a placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\' (bounding box approximately [74, 170, 100, 519]) and tabs for \\'HISTORY\\', \\'CATEGORIES\\', and \\'ADDRESS\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the necessary interface to search for the next waypoint, \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,344],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field labeled \\'Type to search all\\' (center approximately at [87, 344], within bounding box [74, 170, 100, 519]). This action is predicted to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the search field \\'Type to search all\\' (center approximately at [87, 344]) was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. The screen remains on the search interface. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the interface for text input.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Bendern, Liechtenstein\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' into the focused search field \\'Type to search all\\'. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\'. After this action, the search field is expected to contain \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', and search results should appear below the search field. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' into the focused search field was successful. The search field now contains the text \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'. As a result of the input, search results have appeared below the search field. The most prominent result is \\'Liechtenstein Country\\', and there is a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the desired location.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is located below the search bar and has the text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' (bounding box [133, 126, 151, 371]). The center of this text is approximately [142, 249]. This action is predicted to center the map on \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', preparing it to be added as the next waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' (at approximately [142, 249] in the first screenshot) was successful. The screen changed from the search results page to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', as indicated by the title \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' at the top of the screen and the visual centering of the map. The list of waypoints at the bottom still shows \\'Point - 1 Start\\' and \\'Point - 2\\', with a total of 2 points. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the map for adding the third waypoint.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[146,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top left of the screen, with an approximate center at [146, 186] (within bounding box [120, 129, 172, 244]). This action is predicted to open the search interface, allowing me to input the name of the next waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the search icon at [146, 186] (first screenshot) resulted in the screen changing to a view titled \"Triesen, Liechtenstein\" (second screenshot). This screen displays information about \"Triesen, Liechtenstein\" and options like \"SHOW ON MAP\" and \"INCREASE SEARCH RADIUS\". This is not a generic search input screen. The action did not bring the agent closer to inputting \"Bendern, Liechtenstein\" because it seems to have reopened the context of the previous search. The action was partially successful in that it opened *a* search-related screen, but unsuccessful in providing a clear path to search for a *new* location. To correct this, we need to navigate away from this specific search result screen, likely by using the back arrow.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located to the left of the title \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' (approximately at [85, 65]). This action is predicted to navigate to the previous screen, which should be the route planning screen or a search interface, allowing me to search for \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (located at approximately [85, 65] in the first screenshot) was successful. The screen changed from the \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' details view to a search interface. The new screen has a placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\' (bounding box approximately [74, 170, 100, 519]) and tabs for \\'HISTORY\\', \\'CATEGORIES\\', and \\'ADDRESS\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the necessary interface to search for the next waypoint, \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,344],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field labeled \\'Type to search all\\' (center approximately at [87, 344], within bounding box [74, 170, 100, 519]). This action is predicted to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the search field \\'Type to search all\\' (center approximately at [87, 344]) was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. The screen remains on the search interface. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the interface for text input.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Bendern, Liechtenstein\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' into the focused search field \\'Type to search all\\'. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\'. After this action, the search field is expected to contain \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', and search results should appear below the search field. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' into the focused search field was successful. The search field now contains the text \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'. As a result of the input, search results have appeared below the search field. The most prominent result is \\'Liechtenstein Country\\', and there is a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the desired location.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is located below the search bar and has the text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' (bounding box [133, 126, 151, 371]). The center of this text is approximately [142, 249]. This action is predicted to center the map on \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', preparing it to be added as the next waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' (at approximately [142, 249] in the first screenshot) was successful. The screen changed from the search results page to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', as indicated by the title \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' at the top of the screen and the visual centering of the map. The list of waypoints at the bottom still shows \\'Point - 1 Start\\' and \\'Point - 2\\', with a total of 2 points. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the map for adding the third waypoint.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 31: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the map at the location of the blue circle marker (approximately [240, 495]). This action is predicted to add \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' as the third waypoint to the route. The list of waypoints should update to show \\'Point - 3\\', and the total points should become 3. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open OsmAnd app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The OsmAnd app\\'s main screen is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled down, and tapped on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to navigate to the previous screen, which should be the route planning screen or a search interface, allowing me to search for \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (located at approximately [85, 65] in the first screenshot) was successful. The screen changed from the \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' details view to a search interface. The new screen has a placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\' (bounding box approximately [74, 170, 100, 519]) and tabs for \\'HISTORY\\', \\'CATEGORIES\\', and \\'ADDRESS\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the necessary interface to search for the next waypoint, \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,344],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field labeled \\'Type to search all\\' (center approximately at [87, 344], within bounding box [74, 170, 100, 519]). This action is predicted to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the search field \\'Type to search all\\' (center approximately at [87, 344]) was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. The screen remains on the search interface. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the interface for text input.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Bendern, Liechtenstein\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' into the focused search field \\'Type to search all\\'. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\'. After this action, the search field is expected to contain \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', and search results should appear below the search field. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' into the focused search field was successful. The search field now contains the text \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'. As a result of the input, search results have appeared below the search field. The most prominent result is \\'Liechtenstein Country\\', and there is a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the desired location.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is located below the search bar and has the text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' (bounding box [133, 126, 151, 371]). The center of this text is approximately [142, 249]. This action is predicted to center the map on \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', preparing it to be added as the next waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' (at approximately [142, 249] in the first screenshot) was successful. The screen changed from the search results page to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', as indicated by the title \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' at the top of the screen and the visual centering of the map. The list of waypoints at the bottom still shows \\'Point - 1 Start\\' and \\'Point - 2\\', with a total of 2 points. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the map for adding the third waypoint.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the map at the location of the blue circle marker (approximately [240, 495]). This action is predicted to add \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' as the third waypoint to the route. The list of waypoints should update to show \\'Point - 3\\', and the total points should become 3. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the map at the blue circle marker (approximately [240, 495]) was successful. As a result, \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' was added as the third waypoint. The list of waypoints now shows \\'Point - 1 Start\\', \\'Point - 2\\', and \\'Point - 3\\'. The total number of points is 3, and the total distance is 23.1 mi. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully adding the final waypoint.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to navigate to the previous screen, which should be the route planning screen or a search interface, allowing me to search for \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon (located at approximately [85, 65] in the first screenshot) was successful. The screen changed from the \\'Triesen, Liechtenstein\\' details view to a search interface. The new screen has a placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\' (bounding box approximately [74, 170, 100, 519]) and tabs for \\'HISTORY\\', \\'CATEGORIES\\', and \\'ADDRESS\\'.

The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. The screen remains on the search interface. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the interface for text input.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Bendern, Liechtenstein\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' into the focused search field \\'Type to search all\\'. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\'. After this action, the search field is expected to contain \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', and search results should appear below the search field. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' into the focused search field was successful. The search field now contains the text \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'. As a result of the input, search results have appeared below the search field. The most prominent result is \\'Liechtenstein Country\\', and there is a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the desired location.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is located below the search bar and has the text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' (bounding box [133, 126, 151, 371]). The center of this text is approximately [142, 249]. This action is predicted to center the map on \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', preparing it to be added as the next waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' (at approximately [142, 249] in the first screenshot) was successful. The screen changed from the search results page to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', as indicated by the title \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' at the top of the screen and the visual centering of the map. The list of waypoints at the bottom still shows \\'Point - 1 Start\\' and \\'Point - 2\\', with a total of 2 points. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the map for adding the third waypoint.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the map at the location of the blue circle marker (approximately [240, 495]). This action is predicted to add \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' as the third waypoint to the route. The list of waypoints should update to show \\'Point - 3\\', and the total points should become 3. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the map at the blue circle marker (approximately [240, 495]) was successful. As a result, \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' was added as the third waypoint. The list of waypoints now shows \\'Point - 1 Start\\', \\'Point - 2\\', and \\'Point - 3\\'. The total number of points is 3, and the total distance is 23.1 mi. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully adding the final waypoint.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 32: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,344],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search field labeled \\'Type to search all\\' (center approximately at [87, 344], within bounding box [74, 170, 100, 519]). This action is predicted to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing for text input. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the search field \\'Type to search all\\' (center approximately at [87, 344]) was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\' at the bottom of the screen. The screen remains on the search interface. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the interface for text input.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Bendern, Liechtenstein\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' into the focused search field \\'Type to search all\\'. The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\'. After this action, the search field is expected to contain \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', and search results should appear below the search field. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' into the focused search field was successful. The search field now contains the text \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'. As a result of the input, search results have appeared below the search field. The most prominent result is \\'Liechtenstein Country\\', and there is a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the desired location.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is located below the search bar and has the text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' (bounding box [133, 126, 151, 371]). The center of this text is approximately [142, 249]. This action is predicted to center the map on \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', preparing it to be added as the next waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' (at approximately [142, 249] in the first screenshot) was successful. The screen changed from the search results page to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', as indicated by the title \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' at the top of the screen and the visual centering of the map. The list of waypoints at the bottom still shows \\'Point - 1 Start\\' and \\'Point - 2\\', with a total of 2 points. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the map for adding the third waypoint.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the map at the location of the blue circle marker (approximately [240, 495]). This action is predicted to add \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' as the third waypoint to the route. The list of waypoints should update to show \\'Point - 3\\', and the total points should become 3. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the map at the blue circle marker (approximately [240, 495]) was successful. As a result, \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' was added as the third waypoint. The list of waypoints now shows \\'Point - 1 Start\\', \\'Point - 2\\', and \\'Point - 3\\'. The total number of points is 3, and the total distance is 23.1 mi. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully adding the final waypoint.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[947,99],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Options\\' button, located at the bottom left of the screen (text \\'Options\\' with bounding box [937, 35, 958, 164], center approximately [947, 99]). This action is predicted to open a menu or a new screen with options related to the current route, including an option to save the track. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Options\\' button (located at approximately [947, 99] in the first screenshot) was successful. An \\'Options\\' menu appeared on the screen, overlaying the previous map view. This menu contains several relevant options, including \\'Save changes\\' and \\'Save as new track\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the interface to save the track.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 33: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[533,330],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save as new track\\' option in the menu. The text \\'Save as new track\\' is visible with bounding box [524, 172, 542, 489]. This action is predicted to initiate the process of saving the current route as a new track, possibly opening a dialog to name the track. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open OsmAnd app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The OsmAnd app\\'s main screen is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully opened the app drawer, scrolled down, and tapped on the \\'OsmAnd\\' app icon.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\'. After this action, the search field is expected to contain \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', and search results should appear below the search field. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' into the focused search field was successful. The search field now contains the text \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'. As a result of the input, search results have appeared below the search field. The most prominent result is \\'Liechtenstein Country\\', and there is a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the desired location.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is located below the search bar and has the text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' (bounding box [133, 126, 151, 371]). The center of this text is approximately [142, 249]. This action is predicted to center the map on \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', preparing it to be added as the next waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' (at approximately [142, 249] in the first screenshot) was successful. The screen changed from the search results page to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', as indicated by the title \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' at the top of the screen and the visual centering of the map. The list of waypoints at the bottom still shows \\'Point - 1 Start\\' and \\'Point - 2\\', with a total of 2 points. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the map for adding the third waypoint.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the map at the location of the blue circle marker (approximately [240, 495]). This action is predicted to add \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' as the third waypoint to the route. The list of waypoints should update to show \\'Point - 3\\', and the total points should become 3. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the map at the blue circle marker (approximately [240, 495]) was successful. As a result, \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' was added as the third waypoint. The list of waypoints now shows \\'Point - 1 Start\\', \\'Point - 2\\', and \\'Point - 3\\'. The total number of points is 3, and the total distance is 23.1 mi. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully adding the final waypoint.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[947,99],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Options\\' button, located at the bottom left of the screen (text \\'Options\\' with bounding box [937, 35, 958, 164], center approximately [947, 99]). This action is predicted to open a menu or a new screen with options related to the current route, including an option to save the track. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Options\\' button (located at approximately [947, 99] in the first screenshot) was successful. An \\'Options\\' menu appeared on the screen, overlaying the previous map view. This menu contains several relevant options, including \\'Save changes\\' and \\'Save as new track\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the interface to save the track.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[533,330],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save as new track\\' option in the menu. The text \\'Save as new track\\' is visible with bounding box [524, 172, 542, 489]. This action is predicted to initiate the process of saving the current route as a new track, possibly opening a dialog to name the track. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Save as new track\\' (at approximately [533, 330] in the first screenshot) was successful. A \\'Save as new track\\' dialog appeared on the screen. This dialog displays a default filename \\'Sun 15 Oct 2023\\', allows folder selection (currently \\'Tracks\\'), and has toggles for \\'Simplified track\\' and \\'Show on map\\'. \\'Cancel\\' and \\'Save\\' buttons are available at the bottom. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by presenting the interface to finalize saving the track.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The search field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Type to search all\\'. After this action, the search field is expected to contain \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', and search results should appear below the search field. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' into the focused search field was successful. The search field now contains the text \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\'. As a result of the input, search results have appeared below the search field. The most prominent result is \\'Liechtenstein Country\\', and there is a \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully searching for the desired location.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[142,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' button, which is located below the search bar and has the text \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' (bounding box [133, 126, 151, 371]). The center of this text is approximately [142, 249]. This action is predicted to center the map on \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', preparing it to be added as the next waypoint. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'SHOW ON MAP\\' (at approximately [142, 249] in the first screenshot) was successful. The screen changed from the search results page to the map view. The map is now centered on \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\', as indicated by the title \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' at the top of the screen and the visual centering of the map. The list of waypoints at the bottom still shows \\'Point - 1 Start\\' and \\'Point - 2\\', with a total of 2 points. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by preparing the map for adding the third waypoint.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[240,495],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the map at the location of the blue circle marker (approximately [240, 495]). This action is predicted to add \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' as the third waypoint to the route. The list of waypoints should update to show \\'Point - 3\\', and the total points should become 3. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the map at the blue circle marker (approximately [240, 495]) was successful. As a result, \\'Bendern, Liechtenstein\\' was added as the third waypoint. The list of waypoints now shows \\'Point - 1 Start\\', \\'Point - 2\\', and \\'Point - 3\\'. The total number of points is 3, and the total distance is 23.1 mi. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully adding the final waypoint.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[947,99],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Options\\' button, located at the bottom left of the screen (text \\'Options\\' with bounding box [937, 35, 958, 164], center approximately [947, 99]). This action is predicted to open a menu or a new screen with options related to the current route, including an option to save the track. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Options\\' button (located at approximately [947, 99] in the first screenshot) was successful. An \\'Options\\' menu appeared on the screen, overlaying the previous map view. This menu contains several relevant options, including \\'Save changes\\' and \\'Save as new track\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing the interface to save the track.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[533,330],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save as new track\\' option in the menu. The text \\'Save as new track\\' is visible with bounding box [524, 172, 542, 489]. This action is predicted to initiate the process of saving the current route as a new track, possibly opening a dialog to name the track. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Save as new track\\' (at approximately [533, 330] in the first screenshot) was successful. A \\'Save as new track\\' dialog appeared on the screen. This dialog displays a default filename \\'Sun 15 Oct 2023\\', allows folder selection (currently \\'Tracks\\'), and has toggles for \\'Simplified track\\' and \\'Show on map\\'. \\'Cancel\\' and \\'Save\\' buttons are available at the bottom. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by presenting the interface to finalize saving the track.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 34: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[941,741],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save\\' button (bounding box [934, 701, 949, 782], center approximately [941, 741]) in the \\'Save as new track\\' dialog. This action is predicted to save the track with the current settings and close the dialog, possibly returning to the map view or a list of saved tracks.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
