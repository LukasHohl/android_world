Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,499],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the pause button (two vertical bars) located in the center of the screen (approximate bounding box [883, 432, 939, 566], center [911, 499]) to stop the audio recording. This action is expected to stop the recording and potentially present options to save or discard the recording. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the pause button (previously at the center, [911, 499]) was successful. The audio recording transitioned from \"Recording...\" to \"Paused\". The timer shows \"01:52\". The central button now displays \"REC\". To the right of the \"REC\" button, a checkmark/done icon has appeared, and to its left, a delete icon is present. This action has moved the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by pausing the recording. The next step is to finalize this paused recording by tapping the checkmark/done button.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[913,690],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark/done button, located to the right of the \\'REC\\' button (approximate bounding box [886, 642, 941, 738], center [913, 690]). This action is expected to finalize the paused recording and proceed to a screen where the recording can be saved or named. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the checkmark/done button (previously located around [913, 690]) was successful. A \\'New name\\' dialog appeared, prompting for a filename. The dialog contains a text field pre-filled with \\'Record-1\\', which is currently focused, a \\'Don\\'t ask again\\' checkbox, a \\'Cancel\\' button, and a \\'Save\\' button. This action successfully completed Subgoal 3 by finalizing the recording and presenting the save options, moving the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'Record-1\\' from the focused text field. The text field is identified by resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\' and has bounds=\\'[423,123,476,957]\\'. After this action, the text field should be empty, ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action successfully cleared the text \\'Record-1\\' from the focused text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\'). The text field is now empty, as confirmed by both the visual screenshot and the updated XML data (text=\"\"). This action was successful and prepares the text field for the new filename input, moving the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"presentation_fGwr.m4a\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\' into the currently focused and empty text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\', bounds=\\'[123,1034][957,1152]\\'). This will set the filename for the audio recording. After this action, the text field should contain \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\'. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\' into the focused text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\'). The screenshot after the action shows the text field populated with \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\', and the XML data confirms this (text=\"presentation_fGwr.m4a\"). This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,759],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save\\' button (text=\\'Save\\', bounds=\\'[537,647,595,871]\\', center=\\'[566, 759]\\') to save the audio recording with the filename \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\'. This action is expected to close the \\'New name\\' dialog and save the recording. The app might then return to the main recording screen or a list of recordings. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Save\\' button was successful. The \"New name\" dialog closed, and the audio recording was saved with the filename \"presentation_fGwr.m4a\". This is confirmed by the second screenshot, where the filename \"presentation_fGwr.m4a\" is displayed on the main screen of the Audio Recorder app, below the \"00:00\" timer. This action successfully completed Subgoal 4 and, consequently, the entire user instruction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'16.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 712, 65, 797], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [120, 47, 152, 318], \\'text\\': \\'Tue; May 13\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 336, 722, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Gmail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 561, 722, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [704, 781, 722, 921], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [775, 295, 872, 709], \\'text\\': \\'0 (9\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 72, 855, 232]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 764, 856, 929]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 298, 856, 466]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 535, 858, 706]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 536, 729, 695]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 764, 729, 928]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 299, 731, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 701, 948, 794]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [893, 802, 952, 921]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nOpen the file task.html in Downloads in the file manager; when prompted open it with Chrome. Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,499],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the pause button (two vertical bars) located in the center of the screen (approximate bounding box [883, 432, 939, 566], center [911, 499]) to stop the audio recording. This action is expected to stop the recording and potentially present options to save or discard the recording. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the pause button (previously at the center, [911, 499]) was successful. The audio recording transitioned from \"Recording...\" to \"Paused\". The timer shows \"01:52\". The central button now displays \"REC\". To the right of the \"REC\" button, a checkmark/done icon has appeared, and to its left, a delete icon is present. This action has moved the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by pausing the recording. The next step is to finalize this paused recording by tapping the checkmark/done button.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[913,690],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark/done button, located to the right of the \\'REC\\' button (approximate bounding box [886, 642, 941, 738], center [913, 690]). This action is expected to finalize the paused recording and proceed to a screen where the recording can be saved or named. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the checkmark/done button (previously located around [913, 690]) was successful. A \\'New name\\' dialog appeared, prompting for a filename. The dialog contains a text field pre-filled with \\'Record-1\\', which is currently focused, a \\'Don\\'t ask again\\' checkbox, a \\'Cancel\\' button, and a \\'Save\\' button. This action successfully completed Subgoal 3 by finalizing the recording and presenting the save options, moving the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'Record-1\\' from the focused text field. The text field is identified by resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\' and has bounds=\\'[423,123,476,957]\\'. After this action, the text field should be empty, ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action successfully cleared the text \\'Record-1\\' from the focused text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\'). The text field is now empty, as confirmed by both the visual screenshot and the updated XML data (text=\"\"). This action was successful and prepares the text field for the new filename input, moving the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"presentation_fGwr.m4a\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\' into the currently focused and empty text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\', bounds=\\'[123,1034][957,1152]\\'). This will set the filename for the audio recording. After this action, the text field should contain \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\'. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\' into the focused text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\'). The screenshot after the action shows the text field populated with \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\', and the XML data confirms this (text=\"presentation_fGwr.m4a\"). This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,759],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save\\' button (text=\\'Save\\', bounds=\\'[537,647,595,871]\\', center=\\'[566, 759]\\') to save the audio recording with the filename \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\'. This action is expected to close the \\'New name\\' dialog and save the recording. The app might then return to the main recording screen or a list of recordings. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Save\\' button was successful. The \"New name\" dialog closed, and the audio recording was saved with the filename \"presentation_fGwr.m4a\". This is confirmed by the second screenshot, where the filename \"presentation_fGwr.m4a\" is displayed on the main screen of the Audio Recorder app, below the \"00:00\" timer. This action successfully completed Subgoal 4 and, consequently, the entire user instruction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 21: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-center of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"no progress yet\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[\"Swipe up from the approximate center of the screen (e.g., from y=900 to y=300) to open the app drawer.\",\"Visually scan the app drawer for a File Manager app (e.g., \\'Files\\', \\'My Files\\', \\'File Manager\\').\",\"If a File Manager app is found, record its name/description in the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry and tap its icon to open it.\",\"If not found after initial scan and scrolling, and if a search bar is available in the app drawer, use it to search for \\'Files\\'.\"],\"status\":\"no progress yet\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Navigate to Downloads and tap \\'task.html\\'\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'task.html\\' file has been tapped from the Downloads folder within the File Manager, and the system is prompting to choose an application to open it with, or it has opened directly in a default app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"no progress yet\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[\"Once the File Manager is open, look for a \\'Downloads\\' category, folder, or shortcut.\",\"Tap on the \\'Downloads\\' section.\",\"Scroll if necessary to find the file named \\'task.html\\'.\",\"Tap on \\'task.html\\'.\"],\"status\":\"no progress yet\"},{\"ID\":3,\"Title\":\"Open \\'task.html\\' with Chrome\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'task.html\\' file is successfully opened and displayed within the Chrome browser.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"no progress yet\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[\"If an \\'Open with\\' or \\'Complete action using\\' dialog appears after tapping \\'task.html\\', locate \\'Chrome\\' in the list of applications.\",\"Tap on \\'Chrome\\'.\",\"If prompted with \\'Always\\' or \\'Just once\\', tap \\'Just once\\' (or \\'Always\\' if \\'Just once\\' is not available).\"],\"status\":\"no progress yet\"},{\"ID\":4,\"Title\":\"Identify the three colors on \\'task.html\\'\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The three colors from the top of the \\'task.html\\' page are identified, and the `Color1FromPage`, `Color2FromPage`, and `Color3FromPage` memory entries are populated.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"no progress yet\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[\"Observe the top section of the \\'task.html\\' page loaded in Chrome.\",\"Identify the three distinct colors presented there.\",\"Record the first color in the `Color1FromPage` memory entry.\",\"Record the second color in the `Color2FromPage` memory entry.\",\"Record the third color in the `Color3FromPage` memory entry.\"],\"status\":\"no progress yet\"},{\"ID\":5,\"Title\":\"Create a drawing using the identified colors\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"A drawing has been made on the canvas within \\'task.html\\' using each of the three identified colors (`Color1FromPage`, `Color2FromPage`, `Color3FromPage`).\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"no progress yet\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[\"Locate the drawing canvas and color selection tools on the \\'task.html\\' page.\",\"Select the color corresponding to `Color1FromPage`.\",\"Perform a drawing action on the canvas (e.g., draw a line by swiping on the canvas).\",\"Select the color corresponding to `Color2FromPage`.\",\"Perform another drawing action on the canvas.\",\"Select the color corresponding to `Color3FromPage`.\",\"Perform a final drawing action on the canvas.\"],\"status\":\"no progress yet\"},{\"ID\":6,\"Title\":\"Submit the drawing\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Submit\\' button on the \\'task.html\\' page has been tapped, and any subsequent confirmation screen (if any) is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"no progress yet\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[\"Locate the \\'Submit\\' button on the \\'task.html\\' page.\",\"Tap the \\'Submit\\' button.\",\"Send an answer to the user stating the task is complete.\"],\"status\":\"no progress yet\"}],\"activeSubgoalId\":1}\\n\\n\\n\\n### Current Agent Memory ###\\n{\"memory\":[{\"VariableName\":\"IdentifiedFileManagerApp\",\"Content\":\"\",\"Status\":\"This piece of information is sought.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[913,690],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark/done button, located to the right of the \\'REC\\' button (approximate bounding box [886, 642, 941, 738], center [913, 690]). This action is expected to finalize the paused recording and proceed to a screen where the recording can be saved or named. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the checkmark/done button (previously located around [913, 690]) was successful. A \\'New name\\' dialog appeared, prompting for a filename. The dialog contains a text field pre-filled with \\'Record-1\\', which is currently focused, a \\'Don\\'t ask again\\' checkbox, a \\'Cancel\\' button, and a \\'Save\\' button. This action successfully completed Subgoal 3 by finalizing the recording and presenting the save options, moving the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'Record-1\\' from the focused text field. The text field is identified by resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\' and has bounds=\\'[423,123,476,957]\\'. After this action, the text field should be empty, ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action successfully cleared the text \\'Record-1\\' from the focused text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\'). The text field is now empty, as confirmed by both the visual screenshot and the updated XML data (text=\"\"). This action was successful and prepares the text field for the new filename input, moving the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"presentation_fGwr.m4a\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\' into the currently focused and empty text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\', bounds=\\'[123,1034][957,1152]\\'). This will set the filename for the audio recording. After this action, the text field should contain \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\'. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\' into the focused text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\'). The screenshot after the action shows the text field populated with \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\', and the XML data confirms this (text=\"presentation_fGwr.m4a\"). This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,759],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save\\' button (text=\\'Save\\', bounds=\\'[537,647,595,871]\\', center=\\'[566, 759]\\') to save the audio recording with the filename \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\'. This action is expected to close the \\'New name\\' dialog and save the recording. The app might then return to the main recording screen or a list of recordings. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Save\\' button was successful. The \"New name\" dialog closed, and the audio recording was saved with the filename \"presentation_fGwr.m4a\". This is confirmed by the second screenshot, where the filename \"presentation_fGwr.m4a\" is displayed on the main screen of the Audio Recorder app, below the \"00:00\" timer. This action successfully completed Subgoal 4 and, consequently, the entire user instruction.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-center of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the app drawer is where the File Manager app is expected to be found.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[913,690],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark/done button, located to the right of the \\'REC\\' button (approximate bounding box [886, 642, 941, 738], center [913, 690]). This action is expected to finalize the paused recording and proceed to a screen where the recording can be saved or named. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the checkmark/done button (previously located around [913, 690]) was successful. A \\'New name\\' dialog appeared, prompting for a filename. The dialog contains a text field pre-filled with \\'Record-1\\', which is currently focused, a \\'Don\\'t ask again\\' checkbox, a \\'Cancel\\' button, and a \\'Save\\' button. This action successfully completed Subgoal 3 by finalizing the recording and presenting the save options, moving the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'Record-1\\' from the focused text field. The text field is identified by resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\' and has bounds=\\'[423,123,476,957]\\'. After this action, the text field should be empty, ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action successfully cleared the text \\'Record-1\\' from the focused text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\'). The text field is now empty, as confirmed by both the visual screenshot and the updated XML data (text=\"\"). This action was successful and prepares the text field for the new filename input, moving the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"presentation_fGwr.m4a\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\' into the currently focused and empty text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\', bounds=\\'[123,1034][957,1152]\\'). This will set the filename for the audio recording. After this action, the text field should contain \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\'. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\' into the focused text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\'). The screenshot after the action shows the text field populated with \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\', and the XML data confirms this (text=\"presentation_fGwr.m4a\"). This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,759],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save\\' button (text=\\'Save\\', bounds=\\'[537,647,595,871]\\', center=\\'[566, 759]\\') to save the audio recording with the filename \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\'. This action is expected to close the \\'New name\\' dialog and save the recording. The app might then return to the main recording screen or a list of recordings. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Save\\' button was successful. The \"New name\" dialog closed, and the audio recording was saved with the filename \"presentation_fGwr.m4a\". This is confirmed by the second screenshot, where the filename \"presentation_fGwr.m4a\" is displayed on the main screen of the Audio Recorder app, below the \"00:00\" timer. This action successfully completed Subgoal 4 and, consequently, the entire user instruction.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-center of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the app drawer is where the File Manager app is expected to be found.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 22: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon (bounding box [685, 73, 788, 267], center [736, 170]) to open the File Manager app. This action is expected to launch the \\'Files\\' app and display its main interface.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'Record-1\\' from the focused text field. The text field is identified by resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\' and has bounds=\\'[423,123,476,957]\\'. After this action, the text field should be empty, ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action successfully cleared the text \\'Record-1\\' from the focused text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\'). The text field is now empty, as confirmed by both the visual screenshot and the updated XML data (text=\"\"). This action was successful and prepares the text field for the new filename input, moving the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"presentation_fGwr.m4a\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\' into the currently focused and empty text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\', bounds=\\'[123,1034][957,1152]\\'). This will set the filename for the audio recording. After this action, the text field should contain \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\'. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\' into the focused text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\'). The screenshot after the action shows the text field populated with \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\', and the XML data confirms this (text=\"presentation_fGwr.m4a\"). This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,759],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save\\' button (text=\\'Save\\', bounds=\\'[537,647,595,871]\\', center=\\'[566, 759]\\') to save the audio recording with the filename \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\'. This action is expected to close the \\'New name\\' dialog and save the recording. The app might then return to the main recording screen or a list of recordings. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Save\\' button was successful. The \"New name\" dialog closed, and the audio recording was saved with the filename \"presentation_fGwr.m4a\". This is confirmed by the second screenshot, where the filename \"presentation_fGwr.m4a\" is displayed on the main screen of the Audio Recorder app, below the \"00:00\" timer. This action successfully completed Subgoal 4 and, consequently, the entire user instruction.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-center of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the app drawer is where the File Manager app is expected to be found.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon (bounding box [685, 73, 788, 267], center [736, 170]) to open the File Manager app. This action is expected to launch the \\'Files\\' app and display its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Files\\' app icon (text \\'Files\\', approximate center [736, 170]) was successful. The \\'Files\\' app launched and opened directly to the \\'Downloads\\' directory. The file \\'task.html\\' is visible on the screen. This action successfully completed Subgoal 1 (\"Open the File Manager app\") and made significant progress towards Subgoal 2 by already being in the \\'Downloads\\' folder with the target file visible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'16.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 175, 91, 425], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [488, 175, 504, 326], \\'text\\': \\'task html\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 179, 523, 369], \\'text\\': \\'6.50 kB 16.34\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 545, 205, 780]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 313, 205, 533]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 795, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 791, 94, 859]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 861, 94, 971]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [490, 83, 524, 168]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 55, 143, 235]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 818, 40, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [48, 115, 94, 421]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [282, 58, 537, 496]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [231, 841, 259, 923]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [367, 216, 395, 278]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 39, 38, 192]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'Record-1\\' from the focused text field. The text field is identified by resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\' and has bounds=\\'[423,123,476,957]\\'. After this action, the text field should be empty, ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action successfully cleared the text \\'Record-1\\' from the focused text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\'). The text field is now empty, as confirmed by both the visual screenshot and the updated XML data (text=\"\"). This action was successful and prepares the text field for the new filename input, moving the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"presentation_fGwr.m4a\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\' into the currently focused and empty text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\', bounds=\\'[123,1034][957,1152]\\'). This will set the filename for the audio recording. After this action, the text field should contain \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\'. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\' into the focused text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\'). The screenshot after the action shows the text field populated with \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\', and the XML data confirms this (text=\"presentation_fGwr.m4a\"). This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,759],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save\\' button (text=\\'Save\\', bounds=\\'[537,647,595,871]\\', center=\\'[566, 759]\\') to save the audio recording with the filename \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\'. This action is expected to close the \\'New name\\' dialog and save the recording. The app might then return to the main recording screen or a list of recordings. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Save\\' button was successful. The \"New name\" dialog closed, and the audio recording was saved with the filename \"presentation_fGwr.m4a\". This is confirmed by the second screenshot, where the filename \"presentation_fGwr.m4a\" is displayed on the main screen of the Audio Recorder app, below the \"00:00\" timer. This action successfully completed Subgoal 4 and, consequently, the entire user instruction.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-center of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the app drawer is where the File Manager app is expected to be found.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon (bounding box [685, 73, 788, 267], center [736, 170]) to open the File Manager app. This action is expected to launch the \\'Files\\' app and display its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Files\\' app icon (text \\'Files\\', approximate center [736, 170]) was successful. The \\'Files\\' app launched and opened directly to the \\'Downloads\\' directory. The file \\'task.html\\' is visible on the screen. This action successfully completed Subgoal 1 (\"Open the File Manager app\") and made significant progress towards Subgoal 2 by already being in the \\'Downloads\\' folder with the target file visible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 23: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'task.html\\' file (text \\'task html\\' with approximate center [496, 250]) to open it. This is expected to either open the file directly or prompt with an \\'Open with\\' dialog. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below.

This will set the filename for the audio recording. After this action, the text field should contain \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\'. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\' into the focused text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\'). The screenshot after the action shows the text field populated with \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\', and the XML data confirms this (text=\"presentation_fGwr.m4a\"). This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,759],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save\\' button (text=\\'Save\\', bounds=\\'[537,647,595,871]\\', center=\\'[566, 759]\\') to save the audio recording with the filename \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\'. This action is expected to close the \\'New name\\' dialog and save the recording. The app might then return to the main recording screen or a list of recordings. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Save\\' button was successful. The \"New name\" dialog closed, and the audio recording was saved with the filename \"presentation_fGwr.m4a\". This is confirmed by the second screenshot, where the filename \"presentation_fGwr.m4a\" is displayed on the main screen of the Audio Recorder app, below the \"00:00\" timer. This action successfully completed Subgoal 4 and, consequently, the entire user instruction.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-center of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the app drawer is where the File Manager app is expected to be found.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon (bounding box [685, 73, 788, 267], center [736, 170]) to open the File Manager app. This action is expected to launch the \\'Files\\' app and display its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Files\\' app icon (text \\'Files\\', approximate center [736, 170]) was successful. The \\'Files\\' app launched and opened directly to the \\'Downloads\\' directory. The file \\'task.html\\' is visible on the screen. This action successfully completed Subgoal 1 (\"Open the File Manager app\") and made significant progress towards Subgoal 2 by already being in the \\'Downloads\\' folder with the target file visible.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'task.html\\' file (text \\'task html\\' with approximate center [496, 250]) to open it. This is expected to either open the file directly or prompt with an \\'Open with\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'task.html\\' (text \\'task html\\', approximate center [496, 250]) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' page within the File Manager remained displayed, and the \\'task.html\\' file did not open, nor did an \\'Open with\\' dialog appear. Therefore, the action was unsuccessful in advancing the completion of the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'16.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 175, 91, 425], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [488, 175, 504, 326], \\'text\\': \\'task:html\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 179, 523, 369], \\'text\\': \\'6.50 kB 16.34\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 545, 205, 780]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 313, 205, 533]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 795, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 791, 94, 859]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 862, 94, 971]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [490, 83, 524, 168]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 55, 143, 235]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [48, 116, 94, 421]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [282, 58, 537, 496]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [231, 841, 259, 923]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 819, 40, 900]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 903, 38, 946]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [367, 216, 395, 278]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 37, 37, 187]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"presentation_fGwr.m4a\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\' into the currently focused and empty text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\', bounds=\\'[123,1034][957,1152]\\'). This will set the filename for the audio recording. After this action, the text field should contain \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\'. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\' into the focused text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\'). The screenshot after the action shows the text field populated with \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\', and the XML data confirms this (text=\"presentation_fGwr.m4a\"). This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,759],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save\\' button (text=\\'Save\\', bounds=\\'[537,647,595,871]\\', center=\\'[566, 759]\\') to save the audio recording with the filename \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\'. This action is expected to close the \\'New name\\' dialog and save the recording. The app might then return to the main recording screen or a list of recordings. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Save\\' button was successful. The \"New name\" dialog closed, and the audio recording was saved with the filename \"presentation_fGwr.m4a\". This is confirmed by the second screenshot, where the filename \"presentation_fGwr.m4a\" is displayed on the main screen of the Audio Recorder app, below the \"00:00\" timer. This action successfully completed Subgoal 4 and, consequently, the entire user instruction.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-center of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the app drawer is where the File Manager app is expected to be found.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon (bounding box [685, 73, 788, 267], center [736, 170]) to open the File Manager app. This action is expected to launch the \\'Files\\' app and display its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Files\\' app icon (text \\'Files\\', approximate center [736, 170]) was successful. The \\'Files\\' app launched and opened directly to the \\'Downloads\\' directory. The file \\'task.html\\' is visible on the screen. This action successfully completed Subgoal 1 (\"Open the File Manager app\") and made significant progress towards Subgoal 2 by already being in the \\'Downloads\\' folder with the target file visible.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'task.html\\' file (text \\'task html\\' with approximate center [496, 250]) to open it. This is expected to either open the file directly or prompt with an \\'Open with\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'task.html\\' (text \\'task html\\', approximate center [496, 250]) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' page within the File Manager remained displayed, and the \\'task.html\\' file did not open, nor did an \\'Open with\\' dialog appear. Therefore, the action was unsuccessful in advancing the completion of the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 24: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'task.html\\' file (text \\'task.html\\', approximate center [496, 250]) to attempt to open it or reveal an options menu (e.g., \\'Open with\\'). This is expected to either select the file, show a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', or directly trigger an \\'Open with\\' dialog. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,759],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save\\' button (text=\\'Save\\', bounds=\\'[537,647,595,871]\\', center=\\'[566, 759]\\') to save the audio recording with the filename \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\'. This action is expected to close the \\'New name\\' dialog and save the recording. The app might then return to the main recording screen or a list of recordings. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Save\\' button was successful. The \"New name\" dialog closed, and the audio recording was saved with the filename \"presentation_fGwr.m4a\". This is confirmed by the second screenshot, where the filename \"presentation_fGwr.m4a\" is displayed on the main screen of the Audio Recorder app, below the \"00:00\" timer. This action successfully completed Subgoal 4 and, consequently, the entire user instruction.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-center of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the app drawer is where the File Manager app is expected to be found.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon (bounding box [685, 73, 788, 267], center [736, 170]) to open the File Manager app. This action is expected to launch the \\'Files\\' app and display its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Files\\' app icon (text \\'Files\\', approximate center [736, 170]) was successful. The \\'Files\\' app launched and opened directly to the \\'Downloads\\' directory. The file \\'task.html\\' is visible on the screen. This action successfully completed Subgoal 1 (\"Open the File Manager app\") and made significant progress towards Subgoal 2 by already being in the \\'Downloads\\' folder with the target file visible.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'task.html\\' file (text \\'task html\\' with approximate center [496, 250]) to open it. This is expected to either open the file directly or prompt with an \\'Open with\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'task.html\\' (text \\'task html\\', approximate center [496, 250]) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' page within the File Manager remained displayed, and the \\'task.html\\' file did not open, nor did an \\'Open with\\' dialog appear. Therefore, the action was unsuccessful in advancing the completion of the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'task.html\\' file (text \\'task.html\\', approximate center [496, 250]) to attempt to open it or reveal an options menu (e.g., \\'Open with\\'). This is expected to either select the file, show a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', or directly trigger an \\'Open with\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The long press action on \\'task.html\\' (approximate center [496, 250]) was successful in selecting the file. This is indicated by the file being highlighted, a checkmark appearing next to it, and the text \\'1 selected\\' appearing at the top of the screen. New icons for \\'share\\', \\'delete\\', and \\'more options\\' also appeared. While the file is not yet open, selecting it is a necessary prerequisite for further actions like opening it. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'16.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 91, 381], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0 dY: 0.0 selected\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 710, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [488, 175, 504, 326], \\'text\\': \\'task:html\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 179, 523, 369], \\'text\\': \\'6.50 kB 16.34\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 546, 205, 781]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 313, 205, 533]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 795, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [476, 54, 535, 496]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 791, 94, 851]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 37, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [232, 840, 259, 923]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 855, 94, 946]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 40, 37, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 819, 42, 943]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,759],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save\\' button (text=\\'Save\\', bounds=\\'[537,647,595,871]\\', center=\\'[566, 759]\\') to save the audio recording with the filename \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\'. This action is expected to close the \\'New name\\' dialog and save the recording. The app might then return to the main recording screen or a list of recordings. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Save\\' button was successful. The \"New name\" dialog closed, and the audio recording was saved with the filename \"presentation_fGwr.m4a\". This is confirmed by the second screenshot, where the filename \"presentation_fGwr.m4a\" is displayed on the main screen of the Audio Recorder app, below the \"00:00\" timer. This action successfully completed Subgoal 4 and, consequently, the entire user instruction.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-center of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the app drawer is where the File Manager app is expected to be found.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon (bounding box [685, 73, 788, 267], center [736, 170]) to open the File Manager app. This action is expected to launch the \\'Files\\' app and display its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Files\\' app icon (text \\'Files\\', approximate center [736, 170]) was successful. The \\'Files\\' app launched and opened directly to the \\'Downloads\\' directory. The file \\'task.html\\' is visible on the screen. This action successfully completed Subgoal 1 (\"Open the File Manager app\") and made significant progress towards Subgoal 2 by already being in the \\'Downloads\\' folder with the target file visible.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'task.html\\' file (text \\'task html\\' with approximate center [496, 250]) to open it. This is expected to either open the file directly or prompt with an \\'Open with\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'task.html\\' (text \\'task html\\', approximate center [496, 250]) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' page within the File Manager remained displayed, and the \\'task.html\\' file did not open, nor did an \\'Open with\\' dialog appear. Therefore, the action was unsuccessful in advancing the completion of the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'task.html\\' file (text \\'task.html\\', approximate center [496, 250]) to attempt to open it or reveal an options menu (e.g., \\'Open with\\'). This is expected to either select the file, show a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', or directly trigger an \\'Open with\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The long press action on \\'task.html\\' (approximate center [496, 250]) was successful in selecting the file. This is indicated by the file being highlighted, a checkmark appearing next to it, and the text \\'1 selected\\' appearing at the top of the screen. New icons for \\'share\\', \\'delete\\', and \\'more options\\' also appeared. While the file is not yet open, selecting it is a necessary prerequisite for further actions like opening it. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 25: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located in the top right corner (approximate center [80, 900]). This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, including \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the app drawer is where the File Manager app is expected to be found.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon (bounding box [685, 73, 788, 267], center [736, 170]) to open the File Manager app. This action is expected to launch the \\'Files\\' app and display its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Files\\' app icon (text \\'Files\\', approximate center [736, 170]) was successful. The \\'Files\\' app launched and opened directly to the \\'Downloads\\' directory. The file \\'task.html\\' is visible on the screen. This action successfully completed Subgoal 1 (\"Open the File Manager app\") and made significant progress towards Subgoal 2 by already being in the \\'Downloads\\' folder with the target file visible.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'task.html\\' file (text \\'task html\\' with approximate center [496, 250]) to open it. This is expected to either open the file directly or prompt with an \\'Open with\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'task.html\\' (text \\'task html\\', approximate center [496, 250]) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' page within the File Manager remained displayed, and the \\'task.html\\' file did not open, nor did an \\'Open with\\' dialog appear. Therefore, the action was unsuccessful in advancing the completion of the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'task.html\\' file (text \\'task.html\\', approximate center [496, 250]) to attempt to open it or reveal an options menu (e.g., \\'Open with\\'). This is expected to either select the file, show a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', or directly trigger an \\'Open with\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The long press action on \\'task.html\\' (approximate center [496, 250]) was successful in selecting the file. This is indicated by the file being highlighted, a checkmark appearing next to it, and the text \\'1 selected\\' appearing at the top of the screen. New icons for \\'share\\', \\'delete\\', and \\'more options\\' also appeared. While the file is not yet open, selecting it is a necessary prerequisite for further actions like opening it. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located in the top right corner (approximate center [80, 900]). This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, including \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots, approximate center [80, 900] in the previous screen, now visible as the source of the menu in the second screenshot) was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing several options for the selected file \\'task.html\\'. The options include \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing the \\'Open with\\' option.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'16.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 90, 381], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0 dY: 0.0 selected\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 710, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 549, 144, 712], \\'text\\': \\'Open with\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [176, 549, 196, 672], \\'text\\': \\'Sort by.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [229, 549, 246, 737], \\'text\\': \\'Deselect all\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [284, 637, 298, 678], \\'text\\': \\'to.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [335, 552, 351, 684], \\'text\\': \\'Move to.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [386, 547, 407, 716], \\'text\\': \\'Compress\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [440, 550, 455, 683], \\'text\\': \\'Rename\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [488, 175, 504, 326], \\'text\\': \\'task html\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [492, 551, 508, 678], \\'text\\': \\'Get info\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 179, 523, 369], \\'text\\': \\'6.50 kB 16.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [280, 545, 302, 638], \\'text\\': \\'Copy\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [476, 51, 535, 492]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 855, 92, 972]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 314, 204, 520]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 193, 38, 244]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [108, 524, 157, 988]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 789, 93, 854]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 32, 38, 190]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [47, 117, 94, 393]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [159, 531, 213, 980]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-center of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the app drawer is where the File Manager app is expected to be found.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon (bounding box [685, 73, 788, 267], center [736, 170]) to open the File Manager app. This action is expected to launch the \\'Files\\' app and display its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Files\\' app icon (text \\'Files\\', approximate center [736, 170]) was successful. The \\'Files\\' app launched and opened directly to the \\'Downloads\\' directory. The file \\'task.html\\' is visible on the screen. This action successfully completed Subgoal 1 (\"Open the File Manager app\") and made significant progress towards Subgoal 2 by already being in the \\'Downloads\\' folder with the target file visible.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'task.html\\' file (text \\'task html\\' with approximate center [496, 250]) to open it. This is expected to either open the file directly or prompt with an \\'Open with\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'task.html\\' (text \\'task html\\', approximate center [496, 250]) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' page within the File Manager remained displayed, and the \\'task.html\\' file did not open, nor did an \\'Open with\\' dialog appear. Therefore, the action was unsuccessful in advancing the completion of the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'task.html\\' file (text \\'task.html\\', approximate center [496, 250]) to attempt to open it or reveal an options menu (e.g., \\'Open with\\'). This is expected to either select the file, show a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', or directly trigger an \\'Open with\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The long press action on \\'task.html\\' (approximate center [496, 250]) was successful in selecting the file. This is indicated by the file being highlighted, a checkmark appearing next to it, and the text \\'1 selected\\' appearing at the top of the screen. New icons for \\'share\\', \\'delete\\', and \\'more options\\' also appeared. While the file is not yet open, selecting it is a necessary prerequisite for further actions like opening it. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located in the top right corner (approximate center [80, 900]). This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, including \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots, approximate center [80, 900] in the previous screen, now visible as the source of the menu in the second screenshot) was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing several options for the selected file \\'task.html\\'. The options include \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing the \\'Open with\\' option.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 26: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is located at approximately [134, 630] (center of bounding box [124, 549, 144, 712]). This action is expected to either open the file directly with a default application or present a dialog asking which application to use to open the file. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon (bounding box [685, 73, 788, 267], center [736, 170]) to open the File Manager app. This action is expected to launch the \\'Files\\' app and display its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Files\\' app icon (text \\'Files\\', approximate center [736, 170]) was successful. The \\'Files\\' app launched and opened directly to the \\'Downloads\\' directory. The file \\'task.html\\' is visible on the screen. This action successfully completed Subgoal 1 (\"Open the File Manager app\") and made significant progress towards Subgoal 2 by already being in the \\'Downloads\\' folder with the target file visible.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'task.html\\' file (text \\'task html\\' with approximate center [496, 250]) to open it. This is expected to either open the file directly or prompt with an \\'Open with\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'task.html\\' (text \\'task html\\', approximate center [496, 250]) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' page within the File Manager remained displayed, and the \\'task.html\\' file did not open, nor did an \\'Open with\\' dialog appear. Therefore, the action was unsuccessful in advancing the completion of the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'task.html\\' file (text \\'task.html\\', approximate center [496, 250]) to attempt to open it or reveal an options menu (e.g., \\'Open with\\'). This is expected to either select the file, show a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', or directly trigger an \\'Open with\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The long press action on \\'task.html\\' (approximate center [496, 250]) was successful in selecting the file. This is indicated by the file being highlighted, a checkmark appearing next to it, and the text \\'1 selected\\' appearing at the top of the screen. New icons for \\'share\\', \\'delete\\', and \\'more options\\' also appeared. While the file is not yet open, selecting it is a necessary prerequisite for further actions like opening it. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located in the top right corner (approximate center [80, 900]). This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, including \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots, approximate center [80, 900] in the previous screen, now visible as the source of the menu in the second screenshot) was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing several options for the selected file \\'task.html\\'. The options include \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing the \\'Open with\\' option.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is located at approximately [134, 630] (center of bounding box [124, 549, 144, 712]). This action is expected to either open the file directly with a default application or present a dialog asking which application to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Open with\\' (text \\'Open with\\', approximate center [134, 630] in the previous screen) was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, offering choices of applications to open the \\'task.html\\' file. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action successfully brought the agent to the point where it can choose Chrome to open the file, thus completing Subgoal 2 and allowing progress on Subgoal 3.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 42, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'16.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'IXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 205, 91, 379], \\'text\\': \\'selected\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 57, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 271], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 55, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [488, 175, 504, 326], \\'text\\': \\'task html\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 179, 523, 369], \\'text\\': \\'6.50 kB 16.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 70, 942, 182], \\'text\\': \\'Chrome\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 287, 942, 469], \\'text\\': \\'HTML Viewer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 577, 942, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Markor\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 547, 205, 779]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 796, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 57, 205, 297]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 314, 205, 532]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [859, 57, 945, 192]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [858, 556, 947, 694]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [859, 308, 945, 446]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [225, 828, 271, 939]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 54, 145, 234]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [282, 59, 540, 489]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 820, 36, 900]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon (bounding box [685, 73, 788, 267], center [736, 170]) to open the File Manager app. This action is expected to launch the \\'Files\\' app and display its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Files\\' app icon (text \\'Files\\', approximate center [736, 170]) was successful. The \\'Files\\' app launched and opened directly to the \\'Downloads\\' directory. The file \\'task.html\\' is visible on the screen. This action successfully completed Subgoal 1 (\"Open the File Manager app\") and made significant progress towards Subgoal 2 by already being in the \\'Downloads\\' folder with the target file visible.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'task.html\\' file (text \\'task html\\' with approximate center [496, 250]) to open it. This is expected to either open the file directly or prompt with an \\'Open with\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'task.html\\' (text \\'task html\\', approximate center [496, 250]) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' page within the File Manager remained displayed, and the \\'task.html\\' file did not open, nor did an \\'Open with\\' dialog appear. Therefore, the action was unsuccessful in advancing the completion of the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'task.html\\' file (text \\'task.html\\', approximate center [496, 250]) to attempt to open it or reveal an options menu (e.g., \\'Open with\\'). This is expected to either select the file, show a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', or directly trigger an \\'Open with\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The long press action on \\'task.html\\' (approximate center [496, 250]) was successful in selecting the file. This is indicated by the file being highlighted, a checkmark appearing next to it, and the text \\'1 selected\\' appearing at the top of the screen. New icons for \\'share\\', \\'delete\\', and \\'more options\\' also appeared. While the file is not yet open, selecting it is a necessary prerequisite for further actions like opening it. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located in the top right corner (approximate center [80, 900]). This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, including \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots, approximate center [80, 900] in the previous screen, now visible as the source of the menu in the second screenshot) was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing several options for the selected file \\'task.html\\'. The options include \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing the \\'Open with\\' option.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is located at approximately [134, 630] (center of bounding box [124, 549, 144, 712]). This action is expected to either open the file directly with a default application or present a dialog asking which application to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Open with\\' (text \\'Open with\\', approximate center [134, 630] in the previous screen) was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, offering choices of applications to open the \\'task.html\\' file. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action successfully brought the agent to the point where it can choose Chrome to open the file, thus completing Subgoal 2 and allowing progress on Subgoal 3.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 27: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and a Chrome browser icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file in the Chrome browser. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'task.html\\' file (text \\'task html\\' with approximate center [496, 250]) to open it. This is expected to either open the file directly or prompt with an \\'Open with\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'task.html\\' (text \\'task html\\', approximate center [496, 250]) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' page within the File Manager remained displayed, and the \\'task.html\\' file did not open, nor did an \\'Open with\\' dialog appear. Therefore, the action was unsuccessful in advancing the completion of the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'task.html\\' file (text \\'task.html\\', approximate center [496, 250]) to attempt to open it or reveal an options menu (e.g., \\'Open with\\'). This is expected to either select the file, show a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', or directly trigger an \\'Open with\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The long press action on \\'task.html\\' (approximate center [496, 250]) was successful in selecting the file. This is indicated by the file being highlighted, a checkmark appearing next to it, and the text \\'1 selected\\' appearing at the top of the screen. New icons for \\'share\\', \\'delete\\', and \\'more options\\' also appeared. While the file is not yet open, selecting it is a necessary prerequisite for further actions like opening it. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located in the top right corner (approximate center [80, 900]). This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, including \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots, approximate center [80, 900] in the previous screen, now visible as the source of the menu in the second screenshot) was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing several options for the selected file \\'task.html\\'. The options include \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing the \\'Open with\\' option.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is located at approximately [134, 630] (center of bounding box [124, 549, 144, 712]). This action is expected to either open the file directly with a default application or present a dialog asking which application to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Open with\\' (text \\'Open with\\', approximate center [134, 630] in the previous screen) was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, offering choices of applications to open the \\'task.html\\' file. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action successfully brought the agent to the point where it can choose Chrome to open the file, thus completing Subgoal 2 and allowing progress on Subgoal 3.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and a Chrome browser icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file in the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Chrome\\' option (text \\'Chrome\\', approximate center [902, 124] in the previous screen) was successful in launching the Chrome browser. Instead of directly opening the \\'task.html\\' file, Chrome displayed a \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen which requires user interaction (\\'Accept & continue\\') before proceeding. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, but the file itself is not yet open. The next step is to interact with the \\'Accept & continue\\' button.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'16.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [494, 257, 519, 750], \\'text\\': \\'Welcome to Chrome\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [556, 53, 630, 920], \\'text\\': \\'By continuing; you agree to the Terms of Service. To help improve the app; Chrome sends usage and crash data to Google. Manage\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 355, 933, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Accept & continue\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 295, 944, 701]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [607, 298, 628, 425]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [557, 528, 578, 791]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [53, 421, 67, 507]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [52, 852, 67, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 818, 36, 897]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [53, 567, 67, 648]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [329, 364, 453, 635]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 38, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 906, 36, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [52, 709, 67, 803]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 43, 38, 195]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'16.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [222, 36, 252, 381], \\'text\\': \\'Turn on sync?\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [270, 34, 332, 964], \\'text\\': \\'Sync your passwords, history & more on all devices Google may use your history to personalize Search and other Google services\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [368, 38, 390, 767], \\'text\\': \\'You can always choose what to sync in settings.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [922, 64, 937, 230], \\'text\\': \\'No thanks\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [921, 698, 937, 908], \\'text\\': \\'Add account\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [908, 638, 953, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [103, 329, 169, 535]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 819, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 36, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 141, 35, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 907, 36, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [80, 680, 169, 775]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nOpen the file task.html in Downloads in the file manager; when prompted open it with Chrome. Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'task.html\\' file (text \\'task html\\' with approximate center [496, 250]) to open it. This is expected to either open the file directly or prompt with an \\'Open with\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'task.html\\' (text \\'task html\\', approximate center [496, 250]) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' page within the File Manager remained displayed, and the \\'task.html\\' file did not open, nor did an \\'Open with\\' dialog appear. Therefore, the action was unsuccessful in advancing the completion of the active subgoal.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'task.html\\' file (text \\'task.html\\', approximate center [496, 250]) to attempt to open it or reveal an options menu (e.g., \\'Open with\\'). This is expected to either select the file, show a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', or directly trigger an \\'Open with\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The long press action on \\'task.html\\' (approximate center [496, 250]) was successful in selecting the file. This is indicated by the file being highlighted, a checkmark appearing next to it, and the text \\'1 selected\\' appearing at the top of the screen. New icons for \\'share\\', \\'delete\\', and \\'more options\\' also appeared. While the file is not yet open, selecting it is a necessary prerequisite for further actions like opening it. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located in the top right corner (approximate center [80, 900]). This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, including \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots, approximate center [80, 900] in the previous screen, now visible as the source of the menu in the second screenshot) was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing several options for the selected file \\'task.html\\'. The options include \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing the \\'Open with\\' option.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is located at approximately [134, 630] (center of bounding box [124, 549, 144, 712]). This action is expected to either open the file directly with a default application or present a dialog asking which application to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Open with\\' (text \\'Open with\\', approximate center [134, 630] in the previous screen) was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, offering choices of applications to open the \\'task.html\\' file. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action successfully brought the agent to the point where it can choose Chrome to open the file, thus completing Subgoal 2 and allowing progress on Subgoal 3.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and a Chrome browser icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file in the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Chrome\\' option (text \\'Chrome\\', approximate center [902, 124] in the previous screen) was successful in launching the Chrome browser. Instead of directly opening the \\'task.html\\' file, Chrome displayed a \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen which requires user interaction (\\'Accept & continue\\') before proceeding. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, but the file itself is not yet open. The next step is to interact with the \\'Accept & continue\\' button.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 28: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[923,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button (text \\'Accept & continue\\' with approximate center [923, 500]). This action is expected to dismiss the welcome screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and a Chrome browser icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file in the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Chrome\\' option (text \\'Chrome\\', approximate center [902, 124] in the previous screen) was successful in launching the Chrome browser. Instead of directly opening the \\'task.html\\' file, Chrome displayed a \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen which requires user interaction (\\'Accept & continue\\') before proceeding. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, but the file itself is not yet open. The next step is to interact with the \\'Accept & continue\\' button.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[923,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button (text \\'Accept & continue\\' with approximate center [923, 500]). This action is expected to dismiss the welcome screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Accept & continue\\' (approximate center [923, 500] in the previous screen) was successful. It dismissed the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen and presented a new screen asking \\'Turn on sync?\\'. This action moved the agent closer to opening the \\'task.html\\' file by progressing through Chrome\\'s initial setup. However, the file is not yet visible. The next step is to interact with the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen, likely by tapping \\'No thanks\\'.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'16.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [222, 36, 252, 381], \\'text\\': \\'Turn on sync?\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [270, 34, 332, 964], \\'text\\': \\'Sync your passwords, history & more on all devices Google may use your history to personalize Search and other Google services\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [368, 38, 390, 767], \\'text\\': \\'You can always choose what to sync in settings.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [922, 64, 937, 230], \\'text\\': \\'No thanks\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [921, 698, 937, 908], \\'text\\': \\'Add account\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [908, 638, 953, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [103, 329, 169, 535]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 819, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 36, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 141, 35, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 907, 36, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [80, 680, 169, 775]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'task.html\\' file (text \\'task.html\\', approximate center [496, 250]) to attempt to open it or reveal an options menu (e.g., \\'Open with\\'). This is expected to either select the file, show a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', or directly trigger an \\'Open with\\' dialog. Actual Outcome: The long press action on \\'task.html\\' (approximate center [496, 250]) was successful in selecting the file. This is indicated by the file being highlighted, a checkmark appearing next to it, and the text \\'1 selected\\' appearing at the top of the screen. New icons for \\'share\\', \\'delete\\', and \\'more options\\' also appeared. While the file is not yet open, selecting it is a necessary prerequisite for further actions like opening it. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located in the top right corner (approximate center [80, 900]). This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, including \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots, approximate center [80, 900] in the previous screen, now visible as the source of the menu in the second screenshot) was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing several options for the selected file \\'task.html\\'. The options include \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing the \\'Open with\\' option.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is located at approximately [134, 630] (center of bounding box [124, 549, 144, 712]). This action is expected to either open the file directly with a default application or present a dialog asking which application to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Open with\\' (text \\'Open with\\', approximate center [134, 630] in the previous screen) was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, offering choices of applications to open the \\'task.html\\' file. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action successfully brought the agent to the point where it can choose Chrome to open the file, thus completing Subgoal 2 and allowing progress on Subgoal 3.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and a Chrome browser icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file in the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Chrome\\' option (text \\'Chrome\\', approximate center [902, 124] in the previous screen) was successful in launching the Chrome browser. Instead of directly opening the \\'task.html\\' file, Chrome displayed a \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen which requires user interaction (\\'Accept & continue\\') before proceeding.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, including \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots, approximate center [80, 900] in the previous screen, now visible as the source of the menu in the second screenshot) was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing several options for the selected file \\'task.html\\'. The options include \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'.

The \\'Open with\\' text is located at approximately [134, 630] (center of bounding box [124, 549, 144, 712]). This action is expected to either open the file directly with a default application or present a dialog asking which application to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Open with\\' (text \\'Open with\\', approximate center [134, 630] in the previous screen) was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, offering choices of applications to open the \\'task.html\\' file. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action successfully brought the agent to the point where it can choose Chrome to open the file, thus completing Subgoal 2 and allowing progress on Subgoal 3.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and a Chrome browser icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file in the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Chrome\\' option (text \\'Chrome\\', approximate center [902, 124] in the previous screen) was successful in launching the Chrome browser. Instead of directly opening the \\'task.html\\' file, Chrome displayed a \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen which requires user interaction (\\'Accept & continue\\') before proceeding. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, but the file itself is not yet open. The next step is to interact with the \\'Accept & continue\\' button.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[923,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button (text \\'Accept & continue\\' with approximate center [923, 500]). This action is expected to dismiss the welcome screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Accept & continue\\' (approximate center [923, 500] in the previous screen) was successful. It dismissed the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen and presented a new screen asking \\'Turn on sync?\\'. This action moved the agent closer to opening the \\'task.html\\' file by progressing through Chrome\\'s initial setup. However, the file is not yet visible. The next step is to interact with the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen, likely by tapping \\'No thanks\\'.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]). This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]) on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen did not result in any change to the displayed screen. The \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen is still visible. Therefore, the action failed to dismiss the screen and did not bring the agent closer to opening the \\'task.html\\' file. The next step is to retry tapping the \\'No thanks\\' button.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'16.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [222, 36, 252, 381], \\'text\\': \\'Turn on sync?\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [270, 34, 332, 964], \\'text\\': \\'Sync your passwords, history & more on all devices Google may use your history to personalize Search and other Google services\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [368, 38, 390, 767], \\'text\\': \\'You can always choose what to sync in settings.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [922, 64, 937, 230], \\'text\\': \\'No thanks\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [921, 698, 937, 908], \\'text\\': \\'Add account\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [908, 638, 953, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [103, 329, 169, 535]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 819, 35, 863]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 906, 35, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 196, 36, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 141, 35, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [80, 679, 169, 775]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen.

If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located in the top right corner (approximate center [80, 900]). This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, including \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots, approximate center [80, 900] in the previous screen, now visible as the source of the menu in the second screenshot) was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing several options for the selected file \\'task.html\\'. The options include \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing the \\'Open with\\' option.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is located at approximately [134, 630] (center of bounding box [124, 549, 144, 712]). This action is expected to either open the file directly with a default application or present a dialog asking which application to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Open with\\' (text \\'Open with\\', approximate center [134, 630] in the previous screen) was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, offering choices of applications to open the \\'task.html\\' file. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action successfully brought the agent to the point where it can choose Chrome to open the file, thus completing Subgoal 2 and allowing progress on Subgoal 3.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and a Chrome browser icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file in the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Chrome\\' option (text \\'Chrome\\', approximate center [902, 124] in the previous screen) was successful in launching the Chrome browser. Instead of directly opening the \\'task.html\\' file, Chrome displayed a \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen which requires user interaction (\\'Accept & continue\\') before proceeding. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, but the file itself is not yet open. The next step is to interact with the \\'Accept & continue\\' button.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[923,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button (text \\'Accept & continue\\' with approximate center [923, 500]). This action is expected to dismiss the welcome screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Accept & continue\\' (approximate center [923, 500] in the previous screen) was successful. It dismissed the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen and presented a new screen asking \\'Turn on sync?\\'. This action moved the agent closer to opening the \\'task.html\\' file by progressing through Chrome\\'s initial setup. However, the file is not yet visible. The next step is to interact with the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen, likely by tapping \\'No thanks\\'.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]). This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]) on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen did not result in any change to the displayed screen. The \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen is still visible. Therefore, the action failed to dismiss the screen and did not bring the agent closer to opening the \\'task.html\\' file. The next step is to retry tapping the \\'No thanks\\' button.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 30: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]). This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is located at approximately [134, 630] (center of bounding box [124, 549, 144, 712]). This action is expected to either open the file directly with a default application or present a dialog asking which application to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Open with\\' (text \\'Open with\\', approximate center [134, 630] in the previous screen) was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, offering choices of applications to open the \\'task.html\\' file. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action successfully brought the agent to the point where it can choose Chrome to open the file, thus completing Subgoal 2 and allowing progress on Subgoal 3.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and a Chrome browser icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file in the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Chrome\\' option (text \\'Chrome\\', approximate center [902, 124] in the previous screen) was successful in launching the Chrome browser. Instead of directly opening the \\'task.html\\' file, Chrome displayed a \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen which requires user interaction (\\'Accept & continue\\') before proceeding. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, but the file itself is not yet open. The next step is to interact with the \\'Accept & continue\\' button.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[923,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button (text \\'Accept & continue\\' with approximate center [923, 500]). This action is expected to dismiss the welcome screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Accept & continue\\' (approximate center [923, 500] in the previous screen) was successful. It dismissed the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen and presented a new screen asking \\'Turn on sync?\\'. This action moved the agent closer to opening the \\'task.html\\' file by progressing through Chrome\\'s initial setup. However, the file is not yet visible. The next step is to interact with the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen, likely by tapping \\'No thanks\\'.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]). This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]) on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen did not result in any change to the displayed screen. The \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen is still visible. Therefore, the action failed to dismiss the screen and did not bring the agent closer to opening the \\'task.html\\' file. The next step is to retry tapping the \\'No thanks\\' button.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]). This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'No thanks\\' button on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen in Chrome was successful in dismissing that screen. However, instead of loading the \\'task.html\\' file, Chrome either closed or navigated back, returning the view to the \\'Downloads\\' screen within the File Manager app. The \\'task.html\\' file is currently selected on this screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to opening the file in Chrome as Chrome is no longer the active application displaying the file; it was a setback.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 131], \\'text\\': \\'16.41\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 91, 381], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0 dY: 0.0 selected\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 710, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [488, 175, 504, 326], \\'text\\': \\'task html\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 179, 523, 369], \\'text\\': \\'6.50 kB 16.34\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 546, 205, 781]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 313, 205, 533]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 795, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [476, 54, 535, 496]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 792, 94, 851]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [232, 841, 259, 923]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 855, 94, 946]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 819, 42, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 64, 37, 187]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14.

Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is located at approximately [134, 630] (center of bounding box [124, 549, 144, 712]). This action is expected to either open the file directly with a default application or present a dialog asking which application to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Open with\\' (text \\'Open with\\', approximate center [134, 630] in the previous screen) was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, offering choices of applications to open the \\'task.html\\' file. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action successfully brought the agent to the point where it can choose Chrome to open the file, thus completing Subgoal 2 and allowing progress on Subgoal 3.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and a Chrome browser icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file in the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Chrome\\' option (text \\'Chrome\\', approximate center [902, 124] in the previous screen) was successful in launching the Chrome browser. Instead of directly opening the \\'task.html\\' file, Chrome displayed a \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen which requires user interaction (\\'Accept & continue\\') before proceeding. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, but the file itself is not yet open. The next step is to interact with the \\'Accept & continue\\' button.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[923,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button (text \\'Accept & continue\\' with approximate center [923, 500]). This action is expected to dismiss the welcome screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Accept & continue\\' (approximate center [923, 500] in the previous screen) was successful. It dismissed the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen and presented a new screen asking \\'Turn on sync?\\'. This action moved the agent closer to opening the \\'task.html\\' file by progressing through Chrome\\'s initial setup. However, the file is not yet visible. The next step is to interact with the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen, likely by tapping \\'No thanks\\'.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]). This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]) on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen did not result in any change to the displayed screen. The \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen is still visible. Therefore, the action failed to dismiss the screen and did not bring the agent closer to opening the \\'task.html\\' file. The next step is to retry tapping the \\'No thanks\\' button.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]). This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'No thanks\\' button on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen in Chrome was successful in dismissing that screen. However, instead of loading the \\'task.html\\' file, Chrome either closed or navigated back, returning the view to the \\'Downloads\\' screen within the File Manager app. The \\'task.html\\' file is currently selected on this screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to opening the file in Chrome as Chrome is no longer the active application displaying the file; it was a setback.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 31: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located in the top right corner. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and a Chrome browser icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file in the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Chrome\\' option (text \\'Chrome\\', approximate center [902, 124] in the previous screen) was successful in launching the Chrome browser. Instead of directly opening the \\'task.html\\' file, Chrome displayed a \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen which requires user interaction (\\'Accept & continue\\') before proceeding. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, but the file itself is not yet open. The next step is to interact with the \\'Accept & continue\\' button.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[923,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button (text \\'Accept & continue\\' with approximate center [923, 500]). This action is expected to dismiss the welcome screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Accept & continue\\' (approximate center [923, 500] in the previous screen) was successful. It dismissed the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen and presented a new screen asking \\'Turn on sync?\\'. This action moved the agent closer to opening the \\'task.html\\' file by progressing through Chrome\\'s initial setup. However, the file is not yet visible. The next step is to interact with the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen, likely by tapping \\'No thanks\\'.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]). This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]) on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen did not result in any change to the displayed screen. The \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen is still visible. Therefore, the action failed to dismiss the screen and did not bring the agent closer to opening the \\'task.html\\' file. The next step is to retry tapping the \\'No thanks\\' button.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]). This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'No thanks\\' button on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen in Chrome was successful in dismissing that screen. However, instead of loading the \\'task.html\\' file, Chrome either closed or navigated back, returning the view to the \\'Downloads\\' screen within the File Manager app. The \\'task.html\\' file is currently selected on this screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to opening the file in Chrome as Chrome is no longer the active application displaying the file; it was a setback.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located in the top right corner. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots, approximate center [80, 900] in the previous screen) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen, offering several actions for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by allowing the selection of \\'Open with\\' again.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 131], \\'text\\': \\'16.41\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 90, 381], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0 dY: 0.0 selected\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 710, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 549, 144, 712], \\'text\\': \\'Open with\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [176, 549, 196, 672], \\'text\\': \\'Sort by.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [229, 549, 246, 737], \\'text\\': \\'Deselect all\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [284, 637, 298, 678], \\'text\\': \\'to.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [335, 552, 351, 684], \\'text\\': \\'Move to.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [386, 547, 407, 716], \\'text\\': \\'Compress\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [440, 550, 455, 683], \\'text\\': \\'Rename\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [488, 175, 504, 326], \\'text\\': \\'task html\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [492, 551, 508, 678], \\'text\\': \\'Get info\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 179, 523, 369], \\'text\\': \\'6.50 kB 16.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [280, 545, 302, 638], \\'text\\': \\'Copy\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [476, 51, 535, 492]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 855, 92, 972]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 314, 204, 520]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 194, 38, 244]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [108, 524, 157, 988]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 789, 93, 854]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 32, 38, 190]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [47, 117, 94, 393]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [159, 531, 213, 980]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and a Chrome browser icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file in the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Chrome\\' option (text \\'Chrome\\', approximate center [902, 124] in the previous screen) was successful in launching the Chrome browser. Instead of directly opening the \\'task.html\\' file, Chrome displayed a \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen which requires user interaction (\\'Accept & continue\\') before proceeding. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, but the file itself is not yet open. The next step is to interact with the \\'Accept & continue\\' button.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[923,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button (text \\'Accept & continue\\' with approximate center [923, 500]). This action is expected to dismiss the welcome screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Accept & continue\\' (approximate center [923, 500] in the previous screen) was successful. It dismissed the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen and presented a new screen asking \\'Turn on sync?\\'. This action moved the agent closer to opening the \\'task.html\\' file by progressing through Chrome\\'s initial setup. However, the file is not yet visible. The next step is to interact with the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen, likely by tapping \\'No thanks\\'.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]). This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]) on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen did not result in any change to the displayed screen. The \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen is still visible. Therefore, the action failed to dismiss the screen and did not bring the agent closer to opening the \\'task.html\\' file. The next step is to retry tapping the \\'No thanks\\' button.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]). This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'No thanks\\' button on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen in Chrome was successful in dismissing that screen. However, instead of loading the \\'task.html\\' file, Chrome either closed or navigated back, returning the view to the \\'Downloads\\' screen within the File Manager app. The \\'task.html\\' file is currently selected on this screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to opening the file in Chrome as Chrome is no longer the active application displaying the file; it was a setback.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located in the top right corner. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots, approximate center [80, 900] in the previous screen) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen, offering several actions for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by allowing the selection of \\'Open with\\' again.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 32: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is visible with bounding box [124, 549, 144, 712]. This action is expected to display a dialog or list of applications that can open the \\'task.html\\' file, including Chrome. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[923,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button (text \\'Accept & continue\\' with approximate center [923, 500]). This action is expected to dismiss the welcome screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Accept & continue\\' (approximate center [923, 500] in the previous screen) was successful. It dismissed the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen and presented a new screen asking \\'Turn on sync?\\'. This action moved the agent closer to opening the \\'task.html\\' file by progressing through Chrome\\'s initial setup. However, the file is not yet visible. The next step is to interact with the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen, likely by tapping \\'No thanks\\'.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]). This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]) on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen did not result in any change to the displayed screen. The \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen is still visible. Therefore, the action failed to dismiss the screen and did not bring the agent closer to opening the \\'task.html\\' file. The next step is to retry tapping the \\'No thanks\\' button.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]). This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'No thanks\\' button on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen in Chrome was successful in dismissing that screen. However, instead of loading the \\'task.html\\' file, Chrome either closed or navigated back, returning the view to the \\'Downloads\\' screen within the File Manager app. The \\'task.html\\' file is currently selected on this screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to opening the file in Chrome as Chrome is no longer the active application displaying the file; it was a setback.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located in the top right corner. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots, approximate center [80, 900] in the previous screen) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen, offering several actions for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by allowing the selection of \\'Open with\\' again.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is visible with bounding box [124, 549, 144, 712]. This action is expected to display a dialog or list of applications that can open the \\'task.html\\' file, including Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Open with\\' (approximate center [134, 630] in the previous screen) was successful. The context menu disappeared, and a new dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen. This dialog presents three applications: \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\', which can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by presenting the option to select Chrome again.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 41, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'16.42\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'IXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 205, 91, 379], \\'text\\': \\'selected\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 57, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 271], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 55, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [488, 175, 504, 326], \\'text\\': \\'task html\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 179, 523, 369], \\'text\\': \\'6.50 kB 16.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 70, 942, 182], \\'text\\': \\'Chrome\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 287, 942, 469], \\'text\\': \\'HTML Viewer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 577, 942, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Markor\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 547, 205, 779]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 796, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 57, 205, 297]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 314, 205, 532]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [859, 57, 945, 192]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [858, 556, 947, 694]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [859, 308, 945, 446]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [225, 828, 271, 939]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 54, 145, 234]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [282, 59, 540, 489]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 820, 36, 900]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 197, 35, 240]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[923,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button (text \\'Accept & continue\\' with approximate center [923, 500]). This action is expected to dismiss the welcome screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Accept & continue\\' (approximate center [923, 500] in the previous screen) was successful. It dismissed the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen and presented a new screen asking \\'Turn on sync?\\'. This action moved the agent closer to opening the \\'task.html\\' file by progressing through Chrome\\'s initial setup. However, the file is not yet visible. The next step is to interact with the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen, likely by tapping \\'No thanks\\'.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]). This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]) on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen did not result in any change to the displayed screen. The \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen is still visible. Therefore, the action failed to dismiss the screen and did not bring the agent closer to opening the \\'task.html\\' file. The next step is to retry tapping the \\'No thanks\\' button.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]). This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'No thanks\\' button on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen in Chrome was successful in dismissing that screen. However, instead of loading the \\'task.html\\' file, Chrome either closed or navigated back, returning the view to the \\'Downloads\\' screen within the File Manager app. The \\'task.html\\' file is currently selected on this screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to opening the file in Chrome as Chrome is no longer the active application displaying the file; it was a setback.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located in the top right corner. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots, approximate center [80, 900] in the previous screen) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen, offering several actions for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by allowing the selection of \\'Open with\\' again.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is visible with bounding box [124, 549, 144, 712]. This action is expected to display a dialog or list of applications that can open the \\'task.html\\' file, including Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Open with\\' (approximate center [134, 630] in the previous screen) was successful. The context menu disappeared, and a new dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen. This dialog presents three applications: \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\', which can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by presenting the option to select Chrome again.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 33: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is visible with an icon and text at the bottom left of the screen. This action is expected to launch Chrome and open the \\'task.html\\' file. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]) on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen did not result in any change to the displayed screen. The \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen is still visible. Therefore, the action failed to dismiss the screen and did not bring the agent closer to opening the \\'task.html\\' file. The next step is to retry tapping the \\'No thanks\\' button.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]). This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'No thanks\\' button on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen in Chrome was successful in dismissing that screen. However, instead of loading the \\'task.html\\' file, Chrome either closed or navigated back, returning the view to the \\'Downloads\\' screen within the File Manager app. The \\'task.html\\' file is currently selected on this screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to opening the file in Chrome as Chrome is no longer the active application displaying the file; it was a setback.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located in the top right corner. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots, approximate center [80, 900] in the previous screen) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen, offering several actions for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by allowing the selection of \\'Open with\\' again.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is visible with bounding box [124, 549, 144, 712]. This action is expected to display a dialog or list of applications that can open the \\'task.html\\' file, including Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Open with\\' (approximate center [134, 630] in the previous screen) was successful. The context menu disappeared, and a new dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen. This dialog presents three applications: \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\', which can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by presenting the option to select Chrome again.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is visible with an icon and text at the bottom left of the screen. This action is expected to launch Chrome and open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. The \\'task.html\\' file has been opened and is now displayed in a browser. The page content includes three colors at the top, a drawing canvas, a palette of \\'Available Colors\\', and \\'Clear\\' and \\'Submit\\' buttons. This successfully completes Subgoal 3 and allows progression to identifying the colors and drawing, bringing the agent significantly closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]). This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]) on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen did not result in any change to the displayed screen. The \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen is still visible. Therefore, the action failed to dismiss the screen and did not bring the agent closer to opening the \\'task.html\\' file. The next step is to retry tapping the \\'No thanks\\' button.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]). This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'No thanks\\' button on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen in Chrome was successful in dismissing that screen. However, instead of loading the \\'task.html\\' file, Chrome either closed or navigated back, returning the view to the \\'Downloads\\' screen within the File Manager app. The \\'task.html\\' file is currently selected on this screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to opening the file in Chrome as Chrome is no longer the active application displaying the file; it was a setback.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located in the top right corner. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots, approximate center [80, 900] in the previous screen) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen, offering several actions for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by allowing the selection of \\'Open with\\' again.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is visible with bounding box [124, 549, 144, 712]. This action is expected to display a dialog or list of applications that can open the \\'task.html\\' file, including Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Open with\\' (approximate center [134, 630] in the previous screen) was successful. The context menu disappeared, and a new dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen. This dialog presents three applications: \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\', which can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by presenting the option to select Chrome again.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is visible with an icon and text at the bottom left of the screen. This action is expected to launch Chrome and open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. The \\'task.html\\' file has been opened and is now displayed in a browser. The page content includes three colors at the top, a drawing canvas, a palette of \\'Available Colors\\', and \\'Clear\\' and \\'Submit\\' buttons. This successfully completes Subgoal 3 and allows progression to identifying the colors and drawing, bringing the agent significantly closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 34: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]). This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'No thanks\\' button on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen in Chrome was successful in dismissing that screen. However, instead of loading the \\'task.html\\' file, Chrome either closed or navigated back, returning the view to the \\'Downloads\\' screen within the File Manager app. The \\'task.html\\' file is currently selected on this screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to opening the file in Chrome as Chrome is no longer the active application displaying the file; it was a setback.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located in the top right corner. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots, approximate center [80, 900] in the previous screen) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen, offering several actions for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by allowing the selection of \\'Open with\\' again.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is visible with bounding box [124, 549, 144, 712]. This action is expected to display a dialog or list of applications that can open the \\'task.html\\' file, including Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Open with\\' (approximate center [134, 630] in the previous screen) was successful. The context menu disappeared, and a new dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen. This dialog presents three applications: \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\', which can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by presenting the option to select Chrome again.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is visible with an icon and text at the bottom left of the screen. This action is expected to launch Chrome and open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. The \\'task.html\\' file has been opened and is now displayed in a browser. The page content includes three colors at the top, a drawing canvas, a palette of \\'Available Colors\\', and \\'Clear\\' and \\'Submit\\' buttons. This successfully completes Subgoal 3 and allows progression to identifying the colors and drawing, bringing the agent significantly closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The Teal color square is located at approximate bounding box [630, 417, 666, 497]. Tapping its center [648, 457] is expected to select Teal as the active drawing color. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Teal color square (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid did not produce any visible change on the screen. It is currently unconfirmed if the Teal color was successfully selected as the active drawing color. The success of this action will be determined by the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. If the drawing appears in Teal, the color selection was successful.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button (text \\'No thanks\\', approximate center [930, 147]). This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'No thanks\\' button on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen in Chrome was successful in dismissing that screen. However, instead of loading the \\'task.html\\' file, Chrome either closed or navigated back, returning the view to the \\'Downloads\\' screen within the File Manager app. The \\'task.html\\' file is currently selected on this screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to opening the file in Chrome as Chrome is no longer the active application displaying the file; it was a setback.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located in the top right corner. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots, approximate center [80, 900] in the previous screen) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen, offering several actions for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by allowing the selection of \\'Open with\\' again.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is visible with bounding box [124, 549, 144, 712]. This action is expected to display a dialog or list of applications that can open the \\'task.html\\' file, including Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Open with\\' (approximate center [134, 630] in the previous screen) was successful. The context menu disappeared, and a new dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen. This dialog presents three applications: \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\', which can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by presenting the option to select Chrome again.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is visible with an icon and text at the bottom left of the screen. This action is expected to launch Chrome and open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. The \\'task.html\\' file has been opened and is now displayed in a browser. The page content includes three colors at the top, a drawing canvas, a palette of \\'Available Colors\\', and \\'Clear\\' and \\'Submit\\' buttons. This successfully completes Subgoal 3 and allows progression to identifying the colors and drawing, bringing the agent significantly closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The Teal color square is located at approximate bounding box [630, 417, 666, 497]. Tapping its center [648, 457] is expected to select Teal as the active drawing color. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Teal color square (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid did not produce any visible change on the screen. It is currently unconfirmed if the Teal color was successfully selected as the active drawing color. The success of this action will be determined by the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. If the drawing appears in Teal, the color selection was successful. The action\\'s effect is pending verification by the next drawing attempt.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 35: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[700,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe on the canvas from [300,300] to [700,300] to draw a line. This action is intended to draw with the previously selected Teal color. The canvas is currently blank. If the Teal color was successfully selected, a Teal line should appear on the canvas. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The color of the line is red, not the intended Teal color. The rest of the user interface, including the color palettes and buttons, remains unchanged.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located in the top right corner. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots, approximate center [80, 900] in the previous screen) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen, offering several actions for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by allowing the selection of \\'Open with\\' again.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is visible with bounding box [124, 549, 144, 712]. This action is expected to display a dialog or list of applications that can open the \\'task.html\\' file, including Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Open with\\' (approximate center [134, 630] in the previous screen) was successful. The context menu disappeared, and a new dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen. This dialog presents three applications: \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\', which can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by presenting the option to select Chrome again.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is visible with an icon and text at the bottom left of the screen. This action is expected to launch Chrome and open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. The \\'task.html\\' file has been opened and is now displayed in a browser. The page content includes three colors at the top, a drawing canvas, a palette of \\'Available Colors\\', and \\'Clear\\' and \\'Submit\\' buttons. This successfully completes Subgoal 3 and allows progression to identifying the colors and drawing, bringing the agent significantly closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The Teal color square is located at approximate bounding box [630, 417, 666, 497]. Tapping its center [648, 457] is expected to select Teal as the active drawing color. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Teal color square (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid did not produce any visible change on the screen. It is currently unconfirmed if the Teal color was successfully selected as the active drawing color. The success of this action will be determined by the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. If the drawing appears in Teal, the color selection was successful. The action\\'s effect is pending verification by the next drawing attempt.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[700,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe on the canvas from [300,300] to [700,300] to draw a line. This action is intended to draw with the previously selected Teal color. The canvas is currently blank. If the Teal color was successfully selected, a Teal line should appear on the canvas. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300,300] to [700,300] on the canvas resulted in a vertical red line being drawn at approximately x=300. This outcome means the action failed to achieve its intended purpose of drawing a Teal line. The color selection for Teal was unsuccessful, and the drawing behavior (horizontal swipe producing a vertical line) was unexpected. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; it highlighted issues with color selection and the drawing mechanism.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'16.45\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 284, 65, 390], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 960.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 66, 672], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.961\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 144, 97, 755], \\'text\\': \\'@ content://com.android provider:\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [556, 364, 572, 641], \\'text\\': \\'Available Colors:\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [740, 361, 754, 445], \\'text\\': \\'Clear\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [738, 526, 755, 644], \\'text\\': \\'Submit\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [730, 327, 765, 476]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [729, 497, 765, 673]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [129, 434, 185, 565]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [630, 240, 666, 322]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [670, 679, 705, 761]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [592, 240, 627, 323]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [630, 328, 666, 410]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [129, 583, 185, 711]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [630, 766, 666, 849]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [629, 678, 666, 763]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [631, 154, 666, 235]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [592, 328, 627, 410]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [592, 678, 627, 762]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [129, 289, 185, 420]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [592, 415, 627, 499]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [592, 766, 627, 850]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [671, 242, 706, 322]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [592, 153, 627, 235]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [670, 767, 705, 848]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [670, 154, 706, 236]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [630, 591, 665, 673]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [670, 592, 705, 672]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [630, 416, 666, 497]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 794, 107, 873]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [592, 503, 626, 585]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [592, 591, 627, 673]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [630, 502, 665, 586]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [670, 330, 706, 410]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 897, 106, 970]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 115, 107, 204]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 39, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [670, 417, 705, 495]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 141, 38, 186]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 819, 42, 900]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nOpen the file task.html in Downloads in the file manager; when prompted open it with Chrome. Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located in the top right corner. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots, approximate center [80, 900] in the previous screen) was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen, offering several actions for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by allowing the selection of \\'Open with\\' again.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is visible with bounding box [124, 549, 144, 712]. This action is expected to display a dialog or list of applications that can open the \\'task.html\\' file, including Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Open with\\' (approximate center [134, 630] in the previous screen) was successful. The context menu disappeared, and a new dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen. This dialog presents three applications: \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\', which can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by presenting the option to select Chrome again.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is visible with an icon and text at the bottom left of the screen. This action is expected to launch Chrome and open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. The \\'task.html\\' file has been opened and is now displayed in a browser. The page content includes three colors at the top, a drawing canvas, a palette of \\'Available Colors\\', and \\'Clear\\' and \\'Submit\\' buttons. This successfully completes Subgoal 3 and allows progression to identifying the colors and drawing, bringing the agent significantly closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The Teal color square is located at approximate bounding box [630, 417, 666, 497]. Tapping its center [648, 457] is expected to select Teal as the active drawing color. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Teal color square (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid did not produce any visible change on the screen. It is currently unconfirmed if the Teal color was successfully selected as the active drawing color. The success of this action will be determined by the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. If the drawing appears in Teal, the color selection was successful. The action\\'s effect is pending verification by the next drawing attempt.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[700,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe on the canvas from [300,300] to [700,300] to draw a line. This action is intended to draw with the previously selected Teal color. The canvas is currently blank. If the Teal color was successfully selected, a Teal line should appear on the canvas. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300,300] to [700,300] on the canvas resulted in a vertical red line being drawn at approximately x=300. This outcome means the action failed to achieve its intended purpose of drawing a Teal line. The color selection for Teal was unsuccessful, and the drawing behavior (horizontal swipe producing a vertical line) was unexpected. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; it highlighted issues with color selection and the drawing mechanism.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 36: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The Teal color square is located at approximate bounding box [630, 417, 666, 497]. Tapping its center [648, 457] is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line from a previous drawing attempt. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is visible with bounding box [124, 549, 144, 712]. This action is expected to display a dialog or list of applications that can open the \\'task.html\\' file, including Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Open with\\' (approximate center [134, 630] in the previous screen) was successful. The context menu disappeared, and a new dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen. This dialog presents three applications: \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\', which can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by presenting the option to select Chrome again.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is visible with an icon and text at the bottom left of the screen. This action is expected to launch Chrome and open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. The \\'task.html\\' file has been opened and is now displayed in a browser. The page content includes three colors at the top, a drawing canvas, a palette of \\'Available Colors\\', and \\'Clear\\' and \\'Submit\\' buttons. This successfully completes Subgoal 3 and allows progression to identifying the colors and drawing, bringing the agent significantly closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The Teal color square is located at approximate bounding box [630, 417, 666, 497]. Tapping its center [648, 457] is expected to select Teal as the active drawing color. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Teal color square (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid did not produce any visible change on the screen. It is currently unconfirmed if the Teal color was successfully selected as the active drawing color. The success of this action will be determined by the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. If the drawing appears in Teal, the color selection was successful. The action\\'s effect is pending verification by the next drawing attempt.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[700,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe on the canvas from [300,300] to [700,300] to draw a line. This action is intended to draw with the previously selected Teal color. The canvas is currently blank. If the Teal color was successfully selected, a Teal line should appear on the canvas. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300,300] to [700,300] on the canvas resulted in a vertical red line being drawn at approximately x=300. This outcome means the action failed to achieve its intended purpose of drawing a Teal line. The color selection for Teal was unsuccessful, and the drawing behavior (horizontal swipe producing a vertical line) was unexpected. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; it highlighted issues with color selection and the drawing mechanism.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The Teal color square is located at approximate bounding box [630, 417, 666, 497]. Tapping its center [648, 457] is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line from a previous drawing attempt. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Teal color square (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid did not produce any visible change on the screen. This was the second attempt to select the Teal color. The success of this color selection attempt will be determined by the outcome of the next planned action, which is to tap on the canvas to draw. The previous drawing attempt (a swipe) resulted in a red line, indicating the color was not Teal and the drawing mechanism might be tap-based rather than swipe-based. This action\\'s effect is still pending verification by the subsequent drawing attempt.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is visible with bounding box [124, 549, 144, 712]. This action is expected to display a dialog or list of applications that can open the \\'task.html\\' file, including Chrome. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Open with\\' (approximate center [134, 630] in the previous screen) was successful. The context menu disappeared, and a new dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen. This dialog presents three applications: \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\', which can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by presenting the option to select Chrome again.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is visible with an icon and text at the bottom left of the screen. This action is expected to launch Chrome and open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. The \\'task.html\\' file has been opened and is now displayed in a browser. The page content includes three colors at the top, a drawing canvas, a palette of \\'Available Colors\\', and \\'Clear\\' and \\'Submit\\' buttons. This successfully completes Subgoal 3 and allows progression to identifying the colors and drawing, bringing the agent significantly closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The Teal color square is located at approximate bounding box [630, 417, 666, 497]. Tapping its center [648, 457] is expected to select Teal as the active drawing color. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Teal color square (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid did not produce any visible change on the screen. It is currently unconfirmed if the Teal color was successfully selected as the active drawing color. The success of this action will be determined by the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. If the drawing appears in Teal, the color selection was successful. The action\\'s effect is pending verification by the next drawing attempt.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[700,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe on the canvas from [300,300] to [700,300] to draw a line. This action is intended to draw with the previously selected Teal color. The canvas is currently blank. If the Teal color was successfully selected, a Teal line should appear on the canvas. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300,300] to [700,300] on the canvas resulted in a vertical red line being drawn at approximately x=300. This outcome means the action failed to achieve its intended purpose of drawing a Teal line. The color selection for Teal was unsuccessful, and the drawing behavior (horizontal swipe producing a vertical line) was unexpected. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; it highlighted issues with color selection and the drawing mechanism.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The Teal color square is located at approximate bounding box [630, 417, 666, 497]. Tapping its center [648, 457] is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line from a previous drawing attempt. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Teal color square (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid did not produce any visible change on the screen. This was the second attempt to select the Teal color. The success of this color selection attempt will be determined by the outcome of the next planned action, which is to tap on the canvas to draw. The previous drawing attempt (a swipe) resulted in a red line, indicating the color was not Teal and the drawing mechanism might be tap-based rather than swipe-based. This action\\'s effect is still pending verification by the subsequent drawing attempt.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 37: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at point [300, 250]. The canvas currently has a red vertical line. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step. If successful, a Teal mark will appear. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection was not effective. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is visible with an icon and text at the bottom left of the screen. This action is expected to launch Chrome and open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. The \\'task.html\\' file has been opened and is now displayed in a browser. The page content includes three colors at the top, a drawing canvas, a palette of \\'Available Colors\\', and \\'Clear\\' and \\'Submit\\' buttons. This successfully completes Subgoal 3 and allows progression to identifying the colors and drawing, bringing the agent significantly closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The Teal color square is located at approximate bounding box [630, 417, 666, 497]. Tapping its center [648, 457] is expected to select Teal as the active drawing color. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Teal color square (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid did not produce any visible change on the screen. It is currently unconfirmed if the Teal color was successfully selected as the active drawing color. The success of this action will be determined by the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. If the drawing appears in Teal, the color selection was successful. The action\\'s effect is pending verification by the next drawing attempt.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[700,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe on the canvas from [300,300] to [700,300] to draw a line. This action is intended to draw with the previously selected Teal color. The canvas is currently blank. If the Teal color was successfully selected, a Teal line should appear on the canvas. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300,300] to [700,300] on the canvas resulted in a vertical red line being drawn at approximately x=300. This outcome means the action failed to achieve its intended purpose of drawing a Teal line. The color selection for Teal was unsuccessful, and the drawing behavior (horizontal swipe producing a vertical line) was unexpected. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; it highlighted issues with color selection and the drawing mechanism.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The Teal color square is located at approximate bounding box [630, 417, 666, 497]. Tapping its center [648, 457] is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line from a previous drawing attempt. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Teal color square (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid did not produce any visible change on the screen. This was the second attempt to select the Teal color. The success of this color selection attempt will be determined by the outcome of the next planned action, which is to tap on the canvas to draw. The previous drawing attempt (a swipe) resulted in a red line, indicating the color was not Teal and the drawing mechanism might be tap-based rather than swipe-based. This action\\'s effect is still pending verification by the subsequent drawing attempt.\\n Step 37: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at point [300, 250]. The canvas currently has a red vertical line. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step. If successful, a Teal mark will appear. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the canvas at [300, 250] resulted in a small red dot being drawn at that location. This outcome demonstrates that tapping is a valid way to draw on the canvas. However, since the dot was red and not Teal (the color supposedly selected in step 36 by tapping the \\'Available Colors\\' grid), it confirms that the previous color selection attempts were unsuccessful.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is visible with an icon and text at the bottom left of the screen. This action is expected to launch Chrome and open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. The \\'task.html\\' file has been opened and is now displayed in a browser. The page content includes three colors at the top, a drawing canvas, a palette of \\'Available Colors\\', and \\'Clear\\' and \\'Submit\\' buttons. This successfully completes Subgoal 3 and allows progression to identifying the colors and drawing, bringing the agent significantly closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The Teal color square is located at approximate bounding box [630, 417, 666, 497]. Tapping its center [648, 457] is expected to select Teal as the active drawing color. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Teal color square (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid did not produce any visible change on the screen. It is currently unconfirmed if the Teal color was successfully selected as the active drawing color. The success of this action will be determined by the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. If the drawing appears in Teal, the color selection was successful. The action\\'s effect is pending verification by the next drawing attempt.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[700,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe on the canvas from [300,300] to [700,300] to draw a line. This action is intended to draw with the previously selected Teal color. The canvas is currently blank. If the Teal color was successfully selected, a Teal line should appear on the canvas. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300,300] to [700,300] on the canvas resulted in a vertical red line being drawn at approximately x=300. This outcome means the action failed to achieve its intended purpose of drawing a Teal line. The color selection for Teal was unsuccessful, and the drawing behavior (horizontal swipe producing a vertical line) was unexpected. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; it highlighted issues with color selection and the drawing mechanism.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The Teal color square is located at approximate bounding box [630, 417, 666, 497]. Tapping its center [648, 457] is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line from a previous drawing attempt. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Teal color square (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid did not produce any visible change on the screen. This was the second attempt to select the Teal color. The success of this color selection attempt will be determined by the outcome of the next planned action, which is to tap on the canvas to draw. The previous drawing attempt (a swipe) resulted in a red line, indicating the color was not Teal and the drawing mechanism might be tap-based rather than swipe-based. This action\\'s effect is still pending verification by the subsequent drawing attempt.\\n Step 37: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at point [300, 250]. The canvas currently has a red vertical line. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step. If successful, a Teal mark will appear. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the canvas at [300, 250] resulted in a small red dot being drawn at that location. This outcome demonstrates that tapping is a valid way to draw on the canvas. However, since the dot was red and not Teal (the color supposedly selected in step 36 by tapping the \\'Available Colors\\' grid), it confirms that the previous color selection attempts were unsuccessful. The action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and highlighted that the color selection strategy needs to be revised.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 38: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,354],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square located at the top of the page. The approximate bounding box for this Teal square is [129, 289, 185, 419], and its center is [157, 354]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line and a red dot. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The Teal color square is located at approximate bounding box [630, 417, 666, 497]. Tapping its center [648, 457] is expected to select Teal as the active drawing color. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Teal color square (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid did not produce any visible change on the screen. It is currently unconfirmed if the Teal color was successfully selected as the active drawing color. The success of this action will be determined by the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. If the drawing appears in Teal, the color selection was successful. The action\\'s effect is pending verification by the next drawing attempt.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[700,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe on the canvas from [300,300] to [700,300] to draw a line. This action is intended to draw with the previously selected Teal color. The canvas is currently blank. If the Teal color was successfully selected, a Teal line should appear on the canvas. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300,300] to [700,300] on the canvas resulted in a vertical red line being drawn at approximately x=300. This outcome means the action failed to achieve its intended purpose of drawing a Teal line. The color selection for Teal was unsuccessful, and the drawing behavior (horizontal swipe producing a vertical line) was unexpected. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; it highlighted issues with color selection and the drawing mechanism.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The Teal color square is located at approximate bounding box [630, 417, 666, 497]. Tapping its center [648, 457] is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line from a previous drawing attempt. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Teal color square (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid did not produce any visible change on the screen. This was the second attempt to select the Teal color. The success of this color selection attempt will be determined by the outcome of the next planned action, which is to tap on the canvas to draw. The previous drawing attempt (a swipe) resulted in a red line, indicating the color was not Teal and the drawing mechanism might be tap-based rather than swipe-based. This action\\'s effect is still pending verification by the subsequent drawing attempt.\\n Step 37: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at point [300, 250]. The canvas currently has a red vertical line. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step. If successful, a Teal mark will appear. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the canvas at [300, 250] resulted in a small red dot being drawn at that location. This outcome demonstrates that tapping is a valid way to draw on the canvas. However, since the dot was red and not Teal (the color supposedly selected in step 36 by tapping the \\'Available Colors\\' grid), it confirms that the previous color selection attempts were unsuccessful. The action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and highlighted that the color selection strategy needs to be revised.\\n Step 38: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,354],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square located at the top of the page. The approximate bounding box for this Teal square is [129, 289, 185, 419], and its center is [157, 354]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line and a red dot. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Teal color square at the top of the page (center [157, 354]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color was selected. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step to test the hypothesis about color selection, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The Teal color square is located at approximate bounding box [630, 417, 666, 497]. Tapping its center [648, 457] is expected to select Teal as the active drawing color. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Teal color square (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid did not produce any visible change on the screen. It is currently unconfirmed if the Teal color was successfully selected as the active drawing color. The success of this action will be determined by the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. If the drawing appears in Teal, the color selection was successful. The action\\'s effect is pending verification by the next drawing attempt.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[700,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe on the canvas from [300,300] to [700,300] to draw a line. This action is intended to draw with the previously selected Teal color. The canvas is currently blank. If the Teal color was successfully selected, a Teal line should appear on the canvas. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300,300] to [700,300] on the canvas resulted in a vertical red line being drawn at approximately x=300. This outcome means the action failed to achieve its intended purpose of drawing a Teal line. The color selection for Teal was unsuccessful, and the drawing behavior (horizontal swipe producing a vertical line) was unexpected. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; it highlighted issues with color selection and the drawing mechanism.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The Teal color square is located at approximate bounding box [630, 417, 666, 497]. Tapping its center [648, 457] is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line from a previous drawing attempt. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Teal color square (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid did not produce any visible change on the screen. This was the second attempt to select the Teal color. The success of this color selection attempt will be determined by the outcome of the next planned action, which is to tap on the canvas to draw. The previous drawing attempt (a swipe) resulted in a red line, indicating the color was not Teal and the drawing mechanism might be tap-based rather than swipe-based. This action\\'s effect is still pending verification by the subsequent drawing attempt.\\n Step 37: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at point [300, 250]. The canvas currently has a red vertical line. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step. If successful, a Teal mark will appear. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the canvas at [300, 250] resulted in a small red dot being drawn at that location. This outcome demonstrates that tapping is a valid way to draw on the canvas. However, since the dot was red and not Teal (the color supposedly selected in step 36 by tapping the \\'Available Colors\\' grid), it confirms that the previous color selection attempts were unsuccessful. The action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and highlighted that the color selection strategy needs to be revised.\\n Step 38: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,354],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square located at the top of the page. The approximate bounding box for this Teal square is [129, 289, 185, 419], and its center is [157, 354]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line and a red dot. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Teal color square at the top of the page (center [157, 354]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color was selected. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step to test the hypothesis about color selection, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 39: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 250]. The canvas currently has a red line and a red dot. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal square at the top of the page. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [400, 250]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection was not effective. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to draw with the previously selected Teal color. The canvas is currently blank. If the Teal color was successfully selected, a Teal line should appear on the canvas. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300,300] to [700,300] on the canvas resulted in a vertical red line being drawn at approximately x=300. This outcome means the action failed to achieve its intended purpose of drawing a Teal line. The color selection for Teal was unsuccessful, and the drawing behavior (horizontal swipe producing a vertical line) was unexpected. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; it highlighted issues with color selection and the drawing mechanism.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The Teal color square is located at approximate bounding box [630, 417, 666, 497]. Tapping its center [648, 457] is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line from a previous drawing attempt. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Teal color square (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid did not produce any visible change on the screen. This was the second attempt to select the Teal color. The success of this color selection attempt will be determined by the outcome of the next planned action, which is to tap on the canvas to draw. The previous drawing attempt (a swipe) resulted in a red line, indicating the color was not Teal and the drawing mechanism might be tap-based rather than swipe-based. This action\\'s effect is still pending verification by the subsequent drawing attempt.\\n Step 37: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at point [300, 250]. The canvas currently has a red vertical line. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step. If successful, a Teal mark will appear. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the canvas at [300, 250] resulted in a small red dot being drawn at that location. This outcome demonstrates that tapping is a valid way to draw on the canvas. However, since the dot was red and not Teal (the color supposedly selected in step 36 by tapping the \\'Available Colors\\' grid), it confirms that the previous color selection attempts were unsuccessful. The action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and highlighted that the color selection strategy needs to be revised.\\n Step 38: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,354],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square located at the top of the page. The approximate bounding box for this Teal square is [129, 289, 185, 419], and its center is [157, 354]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line and a red dot. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Teal color square at the top of the page (center [157, 354]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color was selected. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step to test the hypothesis about color selection, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 39: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 250]. The canvas currently has a red line and a red dot. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal square at the top of the page. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [400, 250]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the canvas at [400, 250] successfully drew a small red dot at that location. However, the intended color was Teal, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal color swatch at the top of the page. Since the dot is red, it confirms that the Teal color selection was not successful.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[700,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe on the canvas from [300,300] to [700,300] to draw a line. This action is intended to draw with the previously selected Teal color. The canvas is currently blank. If the Teal color was successfully selected, a Teal line should appear on the canvas. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300,300] to [700,300] on the canvas resulted in a vertical red line being drawn at approximately x=300. This outcome means the action failed to achieve its intended purpose of drawing a Teal line. The color selection for Teal was unsuccessful, and the drawing behavior (horizontal swipe producing a vertical line) was unexpected. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; it highlighted issues with color selection and the drawing mechanism.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The Teal color square is located at approximate bounding box [630, 417, 666, 497]. Tapping its center [648, 457] is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line from a previous drawing attempt. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Teal color square (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid did not produce any visible change on the screen. This was the second attempt to select the Teal color. The success of this color selection attempt will be determined by the outcome of the next planned action, which is to tap on the canvas to draw. The previous drawing attempt (a swipe) resulted in a red line, indicating the color was not Teal and the drawing mechanism might be tap-based rather than swipe-based. This action\\'s effect is still pending verification by the subsequent drawing attempt.\\n Step 37: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at point [300, 250]. The canvas currently has a red vertical line. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step. If successful, a Teal mark will appear. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the canvas at [300, 250] resulted in a small red dot being drawn at that location. This outcome demonstrates that tapping is a valid way to draw on the canvas. However, since the dot was red and not Teal (the color supposedly selected in step 36 by tapping the \\'Available Colors\\' grid), it confirms that the previous color selection attempts were unsuccessful. The action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and highlighted that the color selection strategy needs to be revised.\\n Step 38: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,354],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square located at the top of the page. The approximate bounding box for this Teal square is [129, 289, 185, 419], and its center is [157, 354]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line and a red dot. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Teal color square at the top of the page (center [157, 354]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color was selected. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step to test the hypothesis about color selection, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 39: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 250]. The canvas currently has a red line and a red dot. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal square at the top of the page. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [400, 250]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the canvas at [400, 250] successfully drew a small red dot at that location. However, the intended color was Teal, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal color swatch at the top of the page. Since the dot is red, it confirms that the Teal color selection was not successful. The action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and highlighted that the current strategy for color selection (tapping the top swatches) is not working as expected.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 40: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Magenta color swatch located at the top of the page. The approximate bounding box for this Magenta square is [129, 434, 185, 566], and its center is [157, 500]. This action is intended to select Magenta as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line and two red dots. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The Teal color square is located at approximate bounding box [630, 417, 666, 497]. Tapping its center [648, 457] is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line from a previous drawing attempt. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Teal color square (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid did not produce any visible change on the screen. This was the second attempt to select the Teal color. The success of this color selection attempt will be determined by the outcome of the next planned action, which is to tap on the canvas to draw. The previous drawing attempt (a swipe) resulted in a red line, indicating the color was not Teal and the drawing mechanism might be tap-based rather than swipe-based. This action\\'s effect is still pending verification by the subsequent drawing attempt.\\n Step 37: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at point [300, 250]. The canvas currently has a red vertical line. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step. If successful, a Teal mark will appear. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the canvas at [300, 250] resulted in a small red dot being drawn at that location. This outcome demonstrates that tapping is a valid way to draw on the canvas. However, since the dot was red and not Teal (the color supposedly selected in step 36 by tapping the \\'Available Colors\\' grid), it confirms that the previous color selection attempts were unsuccessful. The action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and highlighted that the color selection strategy needs to be revised.\\n Step 38: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,354],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square located at the top of the page. The approximate bounding box for this Teal square is [129, 289, 185, 419], and its center is [157, 354]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line and a red dot. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Teal color square at the top of the page (center [157, 354]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color was selected. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step to test the hypothesis about color selection, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 39: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 250]. The canvas currently has a red line and a red dot. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal square at the top of the page. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [400, 250]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the canvas at [400, 250] successfully drew a small red dot at that location. However, the intended color was Teal, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal color swatch at the top of the page. Since the dot is red, it confirms that the Teal color selection was not successful. The action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and highlighted that the current strategy for color selection (tapping the top swatches) is not working as expected.\\n Step 40: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Magenta color swatch located at the top of the page. The approximate bounding box for this Magenta square is [129, 434, 185, 566], and its center is [157, 500]. This action is intended to select Magenta as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line and two red dots. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Magenta color swatch at the top of the page (center [157, 500]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Magenta color was selected. The success of this action in selecting the Magenta color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step to test the hypothesis about color selection using the top swatches, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The Teal color square is located at approximate bounding box [630, 417, 666, 497]. Tapping its center [648, 457] is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line from a previous drawing attempt. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the Teal color square (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid did not produce any visible change on the screen. This was the second attempt to select the Teal color. The success of this color selection attempt will be determined by the outcome of the next planned action, which is to tap on the canvas to draw. The previous drawing attempt (a swipe) resulted in a red line, indicating the color was not Teal and the drawing mechanism might be tap-based rather than swipe-based. This action\\'s effect is still pending verification by the subsequent drawing attempt.\\n Step 37: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at point [300, 250]. The canvas currently has a red vertical line. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step. If successful, a Teal mark will appear. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the canvas at [300, 250] resulted in a small red dot being drawn at that location. This outcome demonstrates that tapping is a valid way to draw on the canvas. However, since the dot was red and not Teal (the color supposedly selected in step 36 by tapping the \\'Available Colors\\' grid), it confirms that the previous color selection attempts were unsuccessful. The action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and highlighted that the color selection strategy needs to be revised.\\n Step 38: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,354],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square located at the top of the page. The approximate bounding box for this Teal square is [129, 289, 185, 419], and its center is [157, 354]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line and a red dot. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Teal color square at the top of the page (center [157, 354]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color was selected. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step to test the hypothesis about color selection, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 39: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 250]. The canvas currently has a red line and a red dot. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal square at the top of the page. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [400, 250]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the canvas at [400, 250] successfully drew a small red dot at that location. However, the intended color was Teal, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal color swatch at the top of the page. Since the dot is red, it confirms that the Teal color selection was not successful. The action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and highlighted that the current strategy for color selection (tapping the top swatches) is not working as expected.\\n Step 40: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Magenta color swatch located at the top of the page. The approximate bounding box for this Magenta square is [129, 434, 185, 566], and its center is [157, 500]. This action is intended to select Magenta as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line and two red dots. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Magenta color swatch at the top of the page (center [157, 500]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Magenta color was selected. The success of this action in selecting the Magenta color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step to test the hypothesis about color selection using the top swatches, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 41: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,350],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [350, 350]. The canvas currently has a red line and two red dots. This action is intended to create a mark with the Magenta color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Magenta swatch at the top of the page. If successful, a Magenta mark will appear at [350, 350]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red) will appear, indicating the Magenta color selection was not effective.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The canvas currently has a red vertical line. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step. If successful, a Teal mark will appear. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the canvas at [300, 250] resulted in a small red dot being drawn at that location. This outcome demonstrates that tapping is a valid way to draw on the canvas. However, since the dot was red and not Teal (the color supposedly selected in step 36 by tapping the \\'Available Colors\\' grid), it confirms that the previous color selection attempts were unsuccessful. The action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and highlighted that the color selection strategy needs to be revised.\\n Step 38: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,354],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square located at the top of the page. The approximate bounding box for this Teal square is [129, 289, 185, 419], and its center is [157, 354]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line and a red dot. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Teal color square at the top of the page (center [157, 354]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color was selected. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step to test the hypothesis about color selection, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 39: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 250].

This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal square at the top of the page. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [400, 250]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection was not effective.

The approximate bounding box for this Magenta square is [129, 434, 185, 566], and its center is [157, 500]. This action is intended to select Magenta as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line and two red dots. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Magenta color swatch at the top of the page (center [157, 500]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Magenta color was selected. The success of this action in selecting the Magenta color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 37: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at point [300, 250]. The canvas currently has a red vertical line. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step. If successful, a Teal mark will appear. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the canvas at [300, 250] resulted in a small red dot being drawn at that location. This outcome demonstrates that tapping is a valid way to draw on the canvas. However, since the dot was red and not Teal (the color supposedly selected in step 36 by tapping the \\'Available Colors\\' grid), it confirms that the previous color selection attempts were unsuccessful. The action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and highlighted that the color selection strategy needs to be revised.\\n Step 38: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,354],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square located at the top of the page. The approximate bounding box for this Teal square is [129, 289, 185, 419], and its center is [157, 354]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line and a red dot. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Teal color square at the top of the page (center [157, 354]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color was selected. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step to test the hypothesis about color selection, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 39: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 250]. The canvas currently has a red line and a red dot. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal square at the top of the page. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [400, 250]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the canvas at [400, 250] successfully drew a small red dot at that location. However, the intended color was Teal, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal color swatch at the top of the page. Since the dot is red, it confirms that the Teal color selection was not successful. The action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and highlighted that the current strategy for color selection (tapping the top swatches) is not working as expected.\\n Step 40: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Magenta color swatch located at the top of the page. The approximate bounding box for this Magenta square is [129, 434, 185, 566], and its center is [157, 500]. This action is intended to select Magenta as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line and two red dots. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Magenta color swatch at the top of the page (center [157, 500]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Magenta color was selected. The success of this action in selecting the Magenta color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step to test the hypothesis about color selection using the top swatches, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 41: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,350],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [350, 350]. The canvas currently has a red line and two red dots. This action is intended to create a mark with the Magenta color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Magenta swatch at the top of the page. If successful, a Magenta mark will appear at [350, 350]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red) will appear, indicating the Magenta color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [350, 350] successfully drew a small red dot at that location. However, the intended color was Magenta, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Magenta color swatch at the top of the page. Since the dot is red, it confirms that the Magenta color selection via the top swatch was not successful. The drawing color remains red. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and further highlighted that the strategy of tapping the color swatches at the top of the page is ineffective for color selection.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 42: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,401],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clear\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Submit\\' button. The button has the text \\'Clear\\' and its bounding box is [729, 327, 765, 476]. The center is approximately [747, 401]. This action is expected to remove all drawings from the canvas, leaving it blank. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,354],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square located at the top of the page. The approximate bounding box for this Teal square is [129, 289, 185, 419], and its center is [157, 354]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line and a red dot. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Teal color square at the top of the page (center [157, 354]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color was selected. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step to test the hypothesis about color selection, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 39: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 250]. The canvas currently has a red line and a red dot. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal square at the top of the page. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [400, 250]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the canvas at [400, 250] successfully drew a small red dot at that location. However, the intended color was Teal, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal color swatch at the top of the page. Since the dot is red, it confirms that the Teal color selection was not successful. The action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and highlighted that the current strategy for color selection (tapping the top swatches) is not working as expected.\\n Step 40: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Magenta color swatch located at the top of the page. The approximate bounding box for this Magenta square is [129, 434, 185, 566], and its center is [157, 500]. This action is intended to select Magenta as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line and two red dots. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Magenta color swatch at the top of the page (center [157, 500]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Magenta color was selected. The success of this action in selecting the Magenta color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step to test the hypothesis about color selection using the top swatches, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 41: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,350],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [350, 350]. The canvas currently has a red line and two red dots. This action is intended to create a mark with the Magenta color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Magenta swatch at the top of the page. If successful, a Magenta mark will appear at [350, 350]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red) will appear, indicating the Magenta color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [350, 350] successfully drew a small red dot at that location. However, the intended color was Magenta, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Magenta color swatch at the top of the page. Since the dot is red, it confirms that the Magenta color selection via the top swatch was not successful. The drawing color remains red. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and further highlighted that the strategy of tapping the color swatches at the top of the page is ineffective for color selection.\\n Step 42: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,401],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clear\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Submit\\' button. The button has the text \\'Clear\\' and its bounding box is [729, 327, 765, 476]. The center is approximately [747, 401]. This action is expected to remove all drawings from the canvas, leaving it blank. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clear\\' button (located at approximately [747, 401]) was successful. The drawing canvas is now empty, as all previous red markings have been removed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing a clean slate for the drawing task. The next step is to attempt color selection again.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 38: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,354],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color square located at the top of the page. The approximate bounding box for this Teal square is [129, 289, 185, 419], and its center is [157, 354]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line and a red dot. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Teal color square at the top of the page (center [157, 354]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color was selected. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step to test the hypothesis about color selection, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 39: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 250]. The canvas currently has a red line and a red dot. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal square at the top of the page. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [400, 250]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the canvas at [400, 250] successfully drew a small red dot at that location. However, the intended color was Teal, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal color swatch at the top of the page. Since the dot is red, it confirms that the Teal color selection was not successful. The action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and highlighted that the current strategy for color selection (tapping the top swatches) is not working as expected.\\n Step 40: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Magenta color swatch located at the top of the page. The approximate bounding box for this Magenta square is [129, 434, 185, 566], and its center is [157, 500]. This action is intended to select Magenta as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line and two red dots. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Magenta color swatch at the top of the page (center [157, 500]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Magenta color was selected. The success of this action in selecting the Magenta color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step to test the hypothesis about color selection using the top swatches, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 41: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,350],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [350, 350]. The canvas currently has a red line and two red dots. This action is intended to create a mark with the Magenta color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Magenta swatch at the top of the page. If successful, a Magenta mark will appear at [350, 350]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red) will appear, indicating the Magenta color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [350, 350] successfully drew a small red dot at that location. However, the intended color was Magenta, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Magenta color swatch at the top of the page. Since the dot is red, it confirms that the Magenta color selection via the top swatch was not successful. The drawing color remains red. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and further highlighted that the strategy of tapping the color swatches at the top of the page is ineffective for color selection.\\n Step 42: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,401],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clear\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Submit\\' button. The button has the text \\'Clear\\' and its bounding box is [729, 327, 765, 476]. The center is approximately [747, 401]. This action is expected to remove all drawings from the canvas, leaving it blank. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clear\\' button (located at approximately [747, 401]) was successful. The drawing canvas is now empty, as all previous red markings have been removed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing a clean slate for the drawing task. The next step is to attempt color selection again.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 43: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. This swatch is located in the second row, fourth from the left, with an approximate center at [648, 457]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas is currently empty.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The canvas currently has a red line and a red dot. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal square at the top of the page. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [400, 250]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the canvas at [400, 250] successfully drew a small red dot at that location. However, the intended color was Teal, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal color swatch at the top of the page. Since the dot is red, it confirms that the Teal color selection was not successful. The action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and highlighted that the current strategy for color selection (tapping the top swatches) is not working as expected.\\n Step 40: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Magenta color swatch located at the top of the page. The approximate bounding box for this Magenta square is [129, 434, 185, 566], and its center is [157, 500]. This action is intended to select Magenta as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line and two red dots. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Magenta color swatch at the top of the page (center [157, 500]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Magenta color was selected. The success of this action in selecting the Magenta color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step to test the hypothesis about color selection using the top swatches, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 41: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,350],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [350, 350]. The canvas currently has a red line and two red dots. This action is intended to create a mark with the Magenta color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Magenta swatch at the top of the page. If successful, a Magenta mark will appear at [350, 350]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red) will appear, indicating the Magenta color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [350, 350] successfully drew a small red dot at that location. However, the intended color was Magenta, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Magenta color swatch at the top of the page. Since the dot is red, it confirms that the Magenta color selection via the top swatch was not successful. The drawing color remains red. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and further highlighted that the strategy of tapping the color swatches at the top of the page is ineffective for color selection.\\n Step 42: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,401],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clear\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Submit\\' button. The button has the text \\'Clear\\' and its bounding box is [729, 327, 765, 476]. The center is approximately [747, 401]. This action is expected to remove all drawings from the canvas, leaving it blank. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clear\\' button (located at approximately [747, 401]) was successful. The drawing canvas is now empty, as all previous red markings have been removed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing a clean slate for the drawing task. The next step is to attempt color selection again.\\n Step 43: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. This swatch is located in the second row, fourth from the left, with an approximate center at [648, 457]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas is currently empty. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid (approximate center [648, 457]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes. The canvas remains empty, and the color swatches look the same. There is no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color has been selected. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and will be determined by the next action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step in testing the hypothesis that colors can be selected from the \\'Available Colors\\' grid.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 39: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 250]. The canvas currently has a red line and a red dot. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal square at the top of the page. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [400, 250]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the canvas at [400, 250] successfully drew a small red dot at that location. However, the intended color was Teal, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal color swatch at the top of the page. Since the dot is red, it confirms that the Teal color selection was not successful. The action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and highlighted that the current strategy for color selection (tapping the top swatches) is not working as expected.\\n Step 40: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Magenta color swatch located at the top of the page. The approximate bounding box for this Magenta square is [129, 434, 185, 566], and its center is [157, 500]. This action is intended to select Magenta as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line and two red dots. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Magenta color swatch at the top of the page (center [157, 500]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Magenta color was selected. The success of this action in selecting the Magenta color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step to test the hypothesis about color selection using the top swatches, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 41: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,350],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [350, 350]. The canvas currently has a red line and two red dots. This action is intended to create a mark with the Magenta color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Magenta swatch at the top of the page. If successful, a Magenta mark will appear at [350, 350]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red) will appear, indicating the Magenta color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [350, 350] successfully drew a small red dot at that location. However, the intended color was Magenta, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Magenta color swatch at the top of the page. Since the dot is red, it confirms that the Magenta color selection via the top swatch was not successful. The drawing color remains red. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and further highlighted that the strategy of tapping the color swatches at the top of the page is ineffective for color selection.\\n Step 42: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,401],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clear\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Submit\\' button. The button has the text \\'Clear\\' and its bounding box is [729, 327, 765, 476]. The center is approximately [747, 401]. This action is expected to remove all drawings from the canvas, leaving it blank. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clear\\' button (located at approximately [747, 401]) was successful. The drawing canvas is now empty, as all previous red markings have been removed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing a clean slate for the drawing task. The next step is to attempt color selection again.\\n Step 43: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. This swatch is located in the second row, fourth from the left, with an approximate center at [648, 457]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas is currently empty. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid (approximate center [648, 457]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes. The canvas remains empty, and the color swatches look the same. There is no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color has been selected. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and will be determined by the next action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step in testing the hypothesis that colors can be selected from the \\'Available Colors\\' grid.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 44: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [300, 300]. The canvas is currently empty. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [300, 300]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection from the \\'Available Colors\\' grid was not effective. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Magenta color swatch located at the top of the page. The approximate bounding box for this Magenta square is [129, 434, 185, 566], and its center is [157, 500]. This action is intended to select Magenta as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line and two red dots. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Magenta color swatch at the top of the page (center [157, 500]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Magenta color was selected. The success of this action in selecting the Magenta color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step to test the hypothesis about color selection using the top swatches, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 41: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,350],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [350, 350]. The canvas currently has a red line and two red dots. This action is intended to create a mark with the Magenta color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Magenta swatch at the top of the page. If successful, a Magenta mark will appear at [350, 350]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red) will appear, indicating the Magenta color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [350, 350] successfully drew a small red dot at that location. However, the intended color was Magenta, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Magenta color swatch at the top of the page. Since the dot is red, it confirms that the Magenta color selection via the top swatch was not successful. The drawing color remains red. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and further highlighted that the strategy of tapping the color swatches at the top of the page is ineffective for color selection.\\n Step 42: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,401],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clear\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Submit\\' button. The button has the text \\'Clear\\' and its bounding box is [729, 327, 765, 476]. The center is approximately [747, 401]. This action is expected to remove all drawings from the canvas, leaving it blank. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clear\\' button (located at approximately [747, 401]) was successful. The drawing canvas is now empty, as all previous red markings have been removed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing a clean slate for the drawing task. The next step is to attempt color selection again.\\n Step 43: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. This swatch is located in the second row, fourth from the left, with an approximate center at [648, 457]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas is currently empty. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid (approximate center [648, 457]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes. The canvas remains empty, and the color swatches look the same. There is no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color has been selected. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and will be determined by the next action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step in testing the hypothesis that colors can be selected from the \\'Available Colors\\' grid.\\n Step 44: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [300, 300]. The canvas is currently empty. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [300, 300]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection from the \\'Available Colors\\' grid was not effective. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [300, 300] resulted in a small black dot being drawn at that location. The intended color was Teal, which was supposedly selected by tapping the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid in the previous step. Since the dot is black, the Teal color selection was unsuccessful. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and suggests that simply tapping the swatches in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid is not the correct method for color selection, or that the Teal swatch selected black. The drawing color has changed from red to black.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 40: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Magenta color swatch located at the top of the page. The approximate bounding box for this Magenta square is [129, 434, 185, 566], and its center is [157, 500]. This action is intended to select Magenta as the active drawing color. The canvas currently shows a red line and two red dots. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Magenta color swatch at the top of the page (center [157, 500]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Magenta color was selected. The success of this action in selecting the Magenta color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step to test the hypothesis about color selection using the top swatches, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 41: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,350],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [350, 350]. The canvas currently has a red line and two red dots. This action is intended to create a mark with the Magenta color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Magenta swatch at the top of the page. If successful, a Magenta mark will appear at [350, 350]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red) will appear, indicating the Magenta color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [350, 350] successfully drew a small red dot at that location. However, the intended color was Magenta, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Magenta color swatch at the top of the page. Since the dot is red, it confirms that the Magenta color selection via the top swatch was not successful. The drawing color remains red. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and further highlighted that the strategy of tapping the color swatches at the top of the page is ineffective for color selection.\\n Step 42: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,401],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clear\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Submit\\' button. The button has the text \\'Clear\\' and its bounding box is [729, 327, 765, 476]. The center is approximately [747, 401]. This action is expected to remove all drawings from the canvas, leaving it blank. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clear\\' button (located at approximately [747, 401]) was successful. The drawing canvas is now empty, as all previous red markings have been removed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing a clean slate for the drawing task. The next step is to attempt color selection again.\\n Step 43: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. This swatch is located in the second row, fourth from the left, with an approximate center at [648, 457]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas is currently empty. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid (approximate center [648, 457]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes. The canvas remains empty, and the color swatches look the same. There is no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color has been selected. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and will be determined by the next action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step in testing the hypothesis that colors can be selected from the \\'Available Colors\\' grid.\\n Step 44: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [300, 300]. The canvas is currently empty. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [300, 300]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection from the \\'Available Colors\\' grid was not effective. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [300, 300] resulted in a small black dot being drawn at that location. The intended color was Teal, which was supposedly selected by tapping the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid in the previous step. Since the dot is black, the Teal color selection was unsuccessful. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and suggests that simply tapping the swatches in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid is not the correct method for color selection, or that the Teal swatch selected black. The drawing color has changed from red to black.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 45: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. This swatch is located in the second row, fourth from the left, with an approximate center at [648, 457]. The canvas currently has one black dot. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. If successful, a subsequent tap on the canvas should draw in Teal. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,350],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [350, 350]. The canvas currently has a red line and two red dots. This action is intended to create a mark with the Magenta color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Magenta swatch at the top of the page. If successful, a Magenta mark will appear at [350, 350]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red) will appear, indicating the Magenta color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [350, 350] successfully drew a small red dot at that location. However, the intended color was Magenta, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Magenta color swatch at the top of the page. Since the dot is red, it confirms that the Magenta color selection via the top swatch was not successful. The drawing color remains red. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and further highlighted that the strategy of tapping the color swatches at the top of the page is ineffective for color selection.\\n Step 42: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,401],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clear\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Submit\\' button. The button has the text \\'Clear\\' and its bounding box is [729, 327, 765, 476]. The center is approximately [747, 401]. This action is expected to remove all drawings from the canvas, leaving it blank. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clear\\' button (located at approximately [747, 401]) was successful. The drawing canvas is now empty, as all previous red markings have been removed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing a clean slate for the drawing task. The next step is to attempt color selection again.\\n Step 43: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. This swatch is located in the second row, fourth from the left, with an approximate center at [648, 457]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas is currently empty. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid (approximate center [648, 457]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes. The canvas remains empty, and the color swatches look the same. There is no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color has been selected. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and will be determined by the next action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step in testing the hypothesis that colors can be selected from the \\'Available Colors\\' grid.\\n Step 44: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [300, 300]. The canvas is currently empty. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [300, 300]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection from the \\'Available Colors\\' grid was not effective. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [300, 300] resulted in a small black dot being drawn at that location. The intended color was Teal, which was supposedly selected by tapping the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid in the previous step. Since the dot is black, the Teal color selection was unsuccessful. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and suggests that simply tapping the swatches in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid is not the correct method for color selection, or that the Teal swatch selected black. The drawing color has changed from red to black.\\n Step 45: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. This swatch is located in the second row, fourth from the left, with an approximate center at [648, 457]. The canvas currently has one black dot. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. If successful, a subsequent tap on the canvas should draw in Teal. Actual Outcome: The action was a long-press on the Teal color swatch (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The screen shows no visual changes after the action; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color was selected or that the long-press had any effect. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was an attempt to find a working color selection method, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If a Teal mark appears, the long-press strategy is likely correct. If another color (e.g., black or red) appears, the long-press strategy is incorrect, and a new approach for color selection will be needed.\", 'action': {'name': 'Tap on the screen at start_point.

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 41: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,350],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [350, 350]. The canvas currently has a red line and two red dots. This action is intended to create a mark with the Magenta color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Magenta swatch at the top of the page. If successful, a Magenta mark will appear at [350, 350]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red) will appear, indicating the Magenta color selection was not effective. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [350, 350] successfully drew a small red dot at that location. However, the intended color was Magenta, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Magenta color swatch at the top of the page. Since the dot is red, it confirms that the Magenta color selection via the top swatch was not successful. The drawing color remains red. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and further highlighted that the strategy of tapping the color swatches at the top of the page is ineffective for color selection.\\n Step 42: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,401],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clear\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Submit\\' button. The button has the text \\'Clear\\' and its bounding box is [729, 327, 765, 476]. The center is approximately [747, 401]. This action is expected to remove all drawings from the canvas, leaving it blank. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clear\\' button (located at approximately [747, 401]) was successful. The drawing canvas is now empty, as all previous red markings have been removed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing a clean slate for the drawing task. The next step is to attempt color selection again.\\n Step 43: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. This swatch is located in the second row, fourth from the left, with an approximate center at [648, 457]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas is currently empty. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid (approximate center [648, 457]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes. The canvas remains empty, and the color swatches look the same. There is no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color has been selected. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and will be determined by the next action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step in testing the hypothesis that colors can be selected from the \\'Available Colors\\' grid.\\n Step 44: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [300, 300]. The canvas is currently empty. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [300, 300]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection from the \\'Available Colors\\' grid was not effective. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [300, 300] resulted in a small black dot being drawn at that location. The intended color was Teal, which was supposedly selected by tapping the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid in the previous step. Since the dot is black, the Teal color selection was unsuccessful. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and suggests that simply tapping the swatches in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid is not the correct method for color selection, or that the Teal swatch selected black. The drawing color has changed from red to black.\\n Step 45: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. This swatch is located in the second row, fourth from the left, with an approximate center at [648, 457]. The canvas currently has one black dot. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. If successful, a subsequent tap on the canvas should draw in Teal. Actual Outcome: The action was a long-press on the Teal color swatch (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The screen shows no visual changes after the action; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color was selected or that the long-press had any effect. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was an attempt to find a working color selection method, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 46: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 200]. The canvas currently has one black dot at [300,300]. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas. If the Teal color was successfully selected by the previous long-press action on the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid, a Teal mark should appear at [400, 200].

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The button has the text \\'Clear\\' and its bounding box is [729, 327, 765, 476]. The center is approximately [747, 401]. This action is expected to remove all drawings from the canvas, leaving it blank. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clear\\' button (located at approximately [747, 401]) was successful. The drawing canvas is now empty, as all previous red markings have been removed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing a clean slate for the drawing task. The next step is to attempt color selection again.\\n Step 43: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. This swatch is located in the second row, fourth from the left, with an approximate center at [648, 457]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas is currently empty. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid (approximate center [648, 457]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes. The canvas remains empty, and the color swatches look the same. There is no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color has been selected. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and will be determined by the next action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step in testing the hypothesis that colors can be selected from the \\'Available Colors\\' grid.\\n Step 44: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [300, 300]. The canvas is currently empty. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [300, 300]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection from the \\'Available Colors\\' grid was not effective. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [300, 300] resulted in a small black dot being drawn at that location. The intended color was Teal, which was supposedly selected by tapping the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid in the previous step. Since the dot is black, the Teal color selection was unsuccessful. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and suggests that simply tapping the swatches in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid is not the correct method for color selection, or that the Teal swatch selected black. The drawing color has changed from red to black.\\n Step 45: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. This swatch is located in the second row, fourth from the left, with an approximate center at [648, 457]. The canvas currently has one black dot. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. If successful, a subsequent tap on the canvas should draw in Teal. Actual Outcome: The action was a long-press on the Teal color swatch (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The screen shows no visual changes after the action; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color was selected or that the long-press had any effect. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was an attempt to find a working color selection method, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 46: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 200]. The canvas currently has one black dot at [300,300]. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas. If the Teal color was successfully selected by the previous long-press action on the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid, a Teal mark should appear at [400, 200]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely black, the last drawn color, or red, the default) will appear, indicating the long-press on the Teal swatch was not effective for color selection. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [400, 200] resulted in a black dot being drawn at that location. The intended color was Teal, supposedly selected by a long-press on the Teal swatch ([648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid in the previous step. Since the dot is black, the long-press on that Teal swatch was unsuccessful in selecting the Teal color; the drawing color remained black.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 42: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,401],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clear\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Submit\\' button. The button has the text \\'Clear\\' and its bounding box is [729, 327, 765, 476]. The center is approximately [747, 401]. This action is expected to remove all drawings from the canvas, leaving it blank. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clear\\' button (located at approximately [747, 401]) was successful. The drawing canvas is now empty, as all previous red markings have been removed. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing a clean slate for the drawing task. The next step is to attempt color selection again.\\n Step 43: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. This swatch is located in the second row, fourth from the left, with an approximate center at [648, 457]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas is currently empty. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid (approximate center [648, 457]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes. The canvas remains empty, and the color swatches look the same. There is no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color has been selected. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and will be determined by the next action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step in testing the hypothesis that colors can be selected from the \\'Available Colors\\' grid.\\n Step 44: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [300, 300]. The canvas is currently empty. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [300, 300]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection from the \\'Available Colors\\' grid was not effective. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [300, 300] resulted in a small black dot being drawn at that location. The intended color was Teal, which was supposedly selected by tapping the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid in the previous step. Since the dot is black, the Teal color selection was unsuccessful. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and suggests that simply tapping the swatches in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid is not the correct method for color selection, or that the Teal swatch selected black. The drawing color has changed from red to black.\\n Step 45: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. This swatch is located in the second row, fourth from the left, with an approximate center at [648, 457]. The canvas currently has one black dot. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. If successful, a subsequent tap on the canvas should draw in Teal. Actual Outcome: The action was a long-press on the Teal color swatch (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The screen shows no visual changes after the action; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color was selected or that the long-press had any effect. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was an attempt to find a working color selection method, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 46: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 200]. The canvas currently has one black dot at [300,300]. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas. If the Teal color was successfully selected by the previous long-press action on the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid, a Teal mark should appear at [400, 200]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely black, the last drawn color, or red, the default) will appear, indicating the long-press on the Teal swatch was not effective for color selection. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [400, 200] resulted in a black dot being drawn at that location. The intended color was Teal, supposedly selected by a long-press on the Teal swatch ([648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid in the previous step. Since the dot is black, the long-press on that Teal swatch was unsuccessful in selecting the Teal color; the drawing color remained black. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and further demonstrated that the current methods of interacting with the visually Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid are ineffective for selecting Teal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 47: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,401],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clear\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Submit\\' button. The button has the text \\'Clear\\' and its bounding box is [729, 327, 765, 476]. The center is approximately [747, 401]. This action is expected to remove all drawings (the two black dots) from the canvas, leaving it blank. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. This swatch is located in the second row, fourth from the left, with an approximate center at [648, 457]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas is currently empty. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid (approximate center [648, 457]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes. The canvas remains empty, and the color swatches look the same. There is no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color has been selected. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and will be determined by the next action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step in testing the hypothesis that colors can be selected from the \\'Available Colors\\' grid.\\n Step 44: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [300, 300]. The canvas is currently empty. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [300, 300]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection from the \\'Available Colors\\' grid was not effective. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [300, 300] resulted in a small black dot being drawn at that location. The intended color was Teal, which was supposedly selected by tapping the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid in the previous step. Since the dot is black, the Teal color selection was unsuccessful. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and suggests that simply tapping the swatches in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid is not the correct method for color selection, or that the Teal swatch selected black. The drawing color has changed from red to black.\\n Step 45: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. This swatch is located in the second row, fourth from the left, with an approximate center at [648, 457]. The canvas currently has one black dot. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. If successful, a subsequent tap on the canvas should draw in Teal. Actual Outcome: The action was a long-press on the Teal color swatch (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The screen shows no visual changes after the action; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color was selected or that the long-press had any effect. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was an attempt to find a working color selection method, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 46: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 200]. The canvas currently has one black dot at [300,300]. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas. If the Teal color was successfully selected by the previous long-press action on the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid, a Teal mark should appear at [400, 200]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely black, the last drawn color, or red, the default) will appear, indicating the long-press on the Teal swatch was not effective for color selection. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [400, 200] resulted in a black dot being drawn at that location. The intended color was Teal, supposedly selected by a long-press on the Teal swatch ([648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid in the previous step. Since the dot is black, the long-press on that Teal swatch was unsuccessful in selecting the Teal color; the drawing color remained black. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and further demonstrated that the current methods of interacting with the visually Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid are ineffective for selecting Teal.\\n Step 47: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,401],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clear\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Submit\\' button. The button has the text \\'Clear\\' and its bounding box is [729, 327, 765, 476]. The center is approximately [747, 401]. This action is expected to remove all drawings (the two black dots) from the canvas, leaving it blank. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clear\\' button (center approx [747, 401]) was successful. The two black dots that were previously on the canvas have been removed, and the canvas is now empty. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing a clean slate for the drawing task, fulfilling the first step of the current `PlannedNextSteps` for Subgoal 5.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 43: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. This swatch is located in the second row, fourth from the left, with an approximate center at [648, 457]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas is currently empty. Actual Outcome: The action was to tap on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid (approximate center [648, 457]). After the tap, the screen shows no visual changes. The canvas remains empty, and the color swatches look the same. There is no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color has been selected. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and will be determined by the next action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was a necessary step in testing the hypothesis that colors can be selected from the \\'Available Colors\\' grid.\\n Step 44: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [300, 300]. The canvas is currently empty. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [300, 300]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection from the \\'Available Colors\\' grid was not effective. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [300, 300] resulted in a small black dot being drawn at that location. The intended color was Teal, which was supposedly selected by tapping the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid in the previous step. Since the dot is black, the Teal color selection was unsuccessful. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and suggests that simply tapping the swatches in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid is not the correct method for color selection, or that the Teal swatch selected black. The drawing color has changed from red to black.\\n Step 45: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. This swatch is located in the second row, fourth from the left, with an approximate center at [648, 457]. The canvas currently has one black dot. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. If successful, a subsequent tap on the canvas should draw in Teal. Actual Outcome: The action was a long-press on the Teal color swatch (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The screen shows no visual changes after the action; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color was selected or that the long-press had any effect. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was an attempt to find a working color selection method, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 46: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 200]. The canvas currently has one black dot at [300,300]. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas. If the Teal color was successfully selected by the previous long-press action on the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid, a Teal mark should appear at [400, 200]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely black, the last drawn color, or red, the default) will appear, indicating the long-press on the Teal swatch was not effective for color selection. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [400, 200] resulted in a black dot being drawn at that location. The intended color was Teal, supposedly selected by a long-press on the Teal swatch ([648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid in the previous step. Since the dot is black, the long-press on that Teal swatch was unsuccessful in selecting the Teal color; the drawing color remained black. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and further demonstrated that the current methods of interacting with the visually Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid are ineffective for selecting Teal.\\n Step 47: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,401],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clear\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Submit\\' button. The button has the text \\'Clear\\' and its bounding box is [729, 327, 765, 476]. The center is approximately [747, 401]. This action is expected to remove all drawings (the two black dots) from the canvas, leaving it blank. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clear\\' button (center approx [747, 401]) was successful. The two black dots that were previously on the canvas have been removed, and the canvas is now empty. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing a clean slate for the drawing task, fulfilling the first step of the current `PlannedNextSteps` for Subgoal 5.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 48: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,354],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color swatch located at the top of the page. The swatch is the leftmost of the three color swatches at the top, with approximate center [157, 354]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas is currently empty. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [300, 300]. The canvas is currently empty. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [300, 300]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection from the \\'Available Colors\\' grid was not effective. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [300, 300] resulted in a small black dot being drawn at that location. The intended color was Teal, which was supposedly selected by tapping the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid in the previous step. Since the dot is black, the Teal color selection was unsuccessful. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and suggests that simply tapping the swatches in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid is not the correct method for color selection, or that the Teal swatch selected black. The drawing color has changed from red to black.\\n Step 45: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. This swatch is located in the second row, fourth from the left, with an approximate center at [648, 457]. The canvas currently has one black dot. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. If successful, a subsequent tap on the canvas should draw in Teal. Actual Outcome: The action was a long-press on the Teal color swatch (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The screen shows no visual changes after the action; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color was selected or that the long-press had any effect. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was an attempt to find a working color selection method, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 46: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 200]. The canvas currently has one black dot at [300,300]. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas. If the Teal color was successfully selected by the previous long-press action on the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid, a Teal mark should appear at [400, 200]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely black, the last drawn color, or red, the default) will appear, indicating the long-press on the Teal swatch was not effective for color selection. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [400, 200] resulted in a black dot being drawn at that location. The intended color was Teal, supposedly selected by a long-press on the Teal swatch ([648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid in the previous step. Since the dot is black, the long-press on that Teal swatch was unsuccessful in selecting the Teal color; the drawing color remained black. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and further demonstrated that the current methods of interacting with the visually Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid are ineffective for selecting Teal.\\n Step 47: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,401],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clear\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Submit\\' button. The button has the text \\'Clear\\' and its bounding box is [729, 327, 765, 476]. The center is approximately [747, 401]. This action is expected to remove all drawings (the two black dots) from the canvas, leaving it blank. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clear\\' button (center approx [747, 401]) was successful. The two black dots that were previously on the canvas have been removed, and the canvas is now empty. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing a clean slate for the drawing task, fulfilling the first step of the current `PlannedNextSteps` for Subgoal 5.\\n Step 48: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,354],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color swatch located at the top of the page. The swatch is the leftmost of the three color swatches at the top, with approximate center [157, 354]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas is currently empty. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Teal color swatch at the top of the page (approximate center [157, 354]) appears to have been successful. The tapped swatch changed its color from a lighter teal to a darker teal, indicating it has been selected. This brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal of drawing with the three specified colors, as it seems a reliable method for color selection has been found.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 44: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[300,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [300, 300]. The canvas is currently empty. This action is intended to create a mark with the Teal color, which was supposedly selected in the previous step by tapping the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [300, 300]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely red, the default) will appear, indicating the Teal color selection from the \\'Available Colors\\' grid was not effective. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [300, 300] resulted in a small black dot being drawn at that location. The intended color was Teal, which was supposedly selected by tapping the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid in the previous step. Since the dot is black, the Teal color selection was unsuccessful. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and suggests that simply tapping the swatches in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid is not the correct method for color selection, or that the Teal swatch selected black. The drawing color has changed from red to black.\\n Step 45: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. This swatch is located in the second row, fourth from the left, with an approximate center at [648, 457]. The canvas currently has one black dot. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. If successful, a subsequent tap on the canvas should draw in Teal. Actual Outcome: The action was a long-press on the Teal color swatch (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The screen shows no visual changes after the action; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color was selected or that the long-press had any effect. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was an attempt to find a working color selection method, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 46: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 200]. The canvas currently has one black dot at [300,300]. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas. If the Teal color was successfully selected by the previous long-press action on the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid, a Teal mark should appear at [400, 200]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely black, the last drawn color, or red, the default) will appear, indicating the long-press on the Teal swatch was not effective for color selection. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [400, 200] resulted in a black dot being drawn at that location. The intended color was Teal, supposedly selected by a long-press on the Teal swatch ([648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid in the previous step. Since the dot is black, the long-press on that Teal swatch was unsuccessful in selecting the Teal color; the drawing color remained black. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and further demonstrated that the current methods of interacting with the visually Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid are ineffective for selecting Teal.\\n Step 47: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,401],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clear\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Submit\\' button. The button has the text \\'Clear\\' and its bounding box is [729, 327, 765, 476]. The center is approximately [747, 401]. This action is expected to remove all drawings (the two black dots) from the canvas, leaving it blank. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clear\\' button (center approx [747, 401]) was successful. The two black dots that were previously on the canvas have been removed, and the canvas is now empty. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing a clean slate for the drawing task, fulfilling the first step of the current `PlannedNextSteps` for Subgoal 5.\\n Step 48: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,354],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color swatch located at the top of the page. The swatch is the leftmost of the three color swatches at the top, with approximate center [157, 354]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas is currently empty. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Teal color swatch at the top of the page (approximate center [157, 354]) appears to have been successful. The tapped swatch changed its color from a lighter teal to a darker teal, indicating it has been selected. This brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal of drawing with the three specified colors, as it seems a reliable method for color selection has been found. The canvas remains empty, awaiting a drawing action.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 49: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [350, 500]. The canvas is currently empty. The Teal color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Teal color. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [350, 500]. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. This swatch is located in the second row, fourth from the left, with an approximate center at [648, 457]. The canvas currently has one black dot. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. If successful, a subsequent tap on the canvas should draw in Teal. Actual Outcome: The action was a long-press on the Teal color swatch (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The screen shows no visual changes after the action; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color was selected or that the long-press had any effect. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was an attempt to find a working color selection method, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 46: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 200]. The canvas currently has one black dot at [300,300]. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas. If the Teal color was successfully selected by the previous long-press action on the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid, a Teal mark should appear at [400, 200]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely black, the last drawn color, or red, the default) will appear, indicating the long-press on the Teal swatch was not effective for color selection. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [400, 200] resulted in a black dot being drawn at that location. The intended color was Teal, supposedly selected by a long-press on the Teal swatch ([648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid in the previous step. Since the dot is black, the long-press on that Teal swatch was unsuccessful in selecting the Teal color; the drawing color remained black. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and further demonstrated that the current methods of interacting with the visually Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid are ineffective for selecting Teal.\\n Step 47: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,401],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clear\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Submit\\' button. The button has the text \\'Clear\\' and its bounding box is [729, 327, 765, 476]. The center is approximately [747, 401]. This action is expected to remove all drawings (the two black dots) from the canvas, leaving it blank. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clear\\' button (center approx [747, 401]) was successful. The two black dots that were previously on the canvas have been removed, and the canvas is now empty. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing a clean slate for the drawing task, fulfilling the first step of the current `PlannedNextSteps` for Subgoal 5.\\n Step 48: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,354],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color swatch located at the top of the page. The swatch is the leftmost of the three color swatches at the top, with approximate center [157, 354]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas is currently empty. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Teal color swatch at the top of the page (approximate center [157, 354]) appears to have been successful. The tapped swatch changed its color from a lighter teal to a darker teal, indicating it has been selected. This brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal of drawing with the three specified colors, as it seems a reliable method for color selection has been found. The canvas remains empty, awaiting a drawing action.\\n Step 49: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [350, 500]. The canvas is currently empty. The Teal color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Teal color. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [350, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [350, 500] after selecting the Teal color swatch at the top of the page was successful. A Teal dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas. This confirms that tapping the color swatches at the top of the \\'task.html\\' page is the correct method for selecting drawing colors. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the first of the three required colors has been successfully used in the drawing.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 45: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[648,457],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the Teal color swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. This swatch is located in the second row, fourth from the left, with an approximate center at [648, 457]. The canvas currently has one black dot. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. If successful, a subsequent tap on the canvas should draw in Teal. Actual Outcome: The action was a long-press on the Teal color swatch (approximate center [648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid. The screen shows no visual changes after the action; the canvas content and color swatches appear identical to the state before the action. This means there was no immediate visual confirmation that the Teal color was selected or that the long-press had any effect. The success of this action in selecting the Teal color is currently unconfirmed and depends on the outcome of the next planned action, which is to draw on the canvas. This action was an attempt to find a working color selection method, but it has not yet definitively moved the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 46: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 200]. The canvas currently has one black dot at [300,300]. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas. If the Teal color was successfully selected by the previous long-press action on the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid, a Teal mark should appear at [400, 200]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely black, the last drawn color, or red, the default) will appear, indicating the long-press on the Teal swatch was not effective for color selection. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [400, 200] resulted in a black dot being drawn at that location. The intended color was Teal, supposedly selected by a long-press on the Teal swatch ([648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid in the previous step. Since the dot is black, the long-press on that Teal swatch was unsuccessful in selecting the Teal color; the drawing color remained black. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and further demonstrated that the current methods of interacting with the visually Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid are ineffective for selecting Teal.\\n Step 47: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,401],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clear\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Submit\\' button. The button has the text \\'Clear\\' and its bounding box is [729, 327, 765, 476]. The center is approximately [747, 401]. This action is expected to remove all drawings (the two black dots) from the canvas, leaving it blank. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clear\\' button (center approx [747, 401]) was successful. The two black dots that were previously on the canvas have been removed, and the canvas is now empty. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing a clean slate for the drawing task, fulfilling the first step of the current `PlannedNextSteps` for Subgoal 5.\\n Step 48: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,354],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color swatch located at the top of the page. The swatch is the leftmost of the three color swatches at the top, with approximate center [157, 354]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas is currently empty. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Teal color swatch at the top of the page (approximate center [157, 354]) appears to have been successful. The tapped swatch changed its color from a lighter teal to a darker teal, indicating it has been selected. This brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal of drawing with the three specified colors, as it seems a reliable method for color selection has been found. The canvas remains empty, awaiting a drawing action.\\n Step 49: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [350, 500]. The canvas is currently empty. The Teal color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Teal color. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [350, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [350, 500] after selecting the Teal color swatch at the top of the page was successful. A Teal dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas. This confirms that tapping the color swatches at the top of the \\'task.html\\' page is the correct method for selecting drawing colors. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the first of the three required colors has been successfully used in the drawing.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 50: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Magenta color swatch located at the top of the page. This swatch is the middle of the three color swatches, with an approximate center at [157, 500] (bounding box [129, 434, 185, 566]). This action is intended to select Magenta as the active drawing color. The canvas currently has one Teal dot. If successful, the Magenta swatch should change appearance (e.g., become darker). The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 200]. The canvas currently has one black dot at [300,300]. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas. If the Teal color was successfully selected by the previous long-press action on the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid, a Teal mark should appear at [400, 200]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely black, the last drawn color, or red, the default) will appear, indicating the long-press on the Teal swatch was not effective for color selection. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [400, 200] resulted in a black dot being drawn at that location. The intended color was Teal, supposedly selected by a long-press on the Teal swatch ([648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid in the previous step. Since the dot is black, the long-press on that Teal swatch was unsuccessful in selecting the Teal color; the drawing color remained black. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and further demonstrated that the current methods of interacting with the visually Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid are ineffective for selecting Teal.\\n Step 47: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,401],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clear\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Submit\\' button. The button has the text \\'Clear\\' and its bounding box is [729, 327, 765, 476]. The center is approximately [747, 401]. This action is expected to remove all drawings (the two black dots) from the canvas, leaving it blank. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clear\\' button (center approx [747, 401]) was successful. The two black dots that were previously on the canvas have been removed, and the canvas is now empty. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing a clean slate for the drawing task, fulfilling the first step of the current `PlannedNextSteps` for Subgoal 5.\\n Step 48: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,354],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color swatch located at the top of the page. The swatch is the leftmost of the three color swatches at the top, with approximate center [157, 354]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas is currently empty. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Teal color swatch at the top of the page (approximate center [157, 354]) appears to have been successful. The tapped swatch changed its color from a lighter teal to a darker teal, indicating it has been selected. This brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal of drawing with the three specified colors, as it seems a reliable method for color selection has been found. The canvas remains empty, awaiting a drawing action.\\n Step 49: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [350, 500]. The canvas is currently empty. The Teal color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Teal color. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [350, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [350, 500] after selecting the Teal color swatch at the top of the page was successful. A Teal dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas. This confirms that tapping the color swatches at the top of the \\'task.html\\' page is the correct method for selecting drawing colors. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the first of the three required colors has been successfully used in the drawing.\\n Step 50: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Magenta color swatch located at the top of the page. This swatch is the middle of the three color swatches, with an approximate center at [157, 500] (bounding box [129, 434, 185, 566]). This action is intended to select Magenta as the active drawing color. The canvas currently has one Teal dot. If successful, the Magenta swatch should change appearance (e.g., become darker). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Magenta color swatch (approximate center [157, 500]) at the top of the page was successful. The Magenta swatch changed its appearance to a darker shade, and the previously selected Teal swatch reverted to its lighter shade, indicating that Magenta is now the selected drawing color. This action moves the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the second of the three required colors has been selected.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 46: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 200]. The canvas currently has one black dot at [300,300]. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas. If the Teal color was successfully selected by the previous long-press action on the Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid, a Teal mark should appear at [400, 200]. If not, a mark of a different color (likely black, the last drawn color, or red, the default) will appear, indicating the long-press on the Teal swatch was not effective for color selection. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [400, 200] resulted in a black dot being drawn at that location. The intended color was Teal, supposedly selected by a long-press on the Teal swatch ([648, 457]) in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid in the previous step. Since the dot is black, the long-press on that Teal swatch was unsuccessful in selecting the Teal color; the drawing color remained black. This action did not bring the agent closer to drawing with the specified colors and further demonstrated that the current methods of interacting with the visually Teal swatch in the \\'Available Colors\\' grid are ineffective for selecting Teal.\\n Step 47: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,401],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clear\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Submit\\' button. The button has the text \\'Clear\\' and its bounding box is [729, 327, 765, 476]. The center is approximately [747, 401]. This action is expected to remove all drawings (the two black dots) from the canvas, leaving it blank. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clear\\' button (center approx [747, 401]) was successful. The two black dots that were previously on the canvas have been removed, and the canvas is now empty. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing a clean slate for the drawing task, fulfilling the first step of the current `PlannedNextSteps` for Subgoal 5.\\n Step 48: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,354],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color swatch located at the top of the page. The swatch is the leftmost of the three color swatches at the top, with approximate center [157, 354]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas is currently empty. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Teal color swatch at the top of the page (approximate center [157, 354]) appears to have been successful. The tapped swatch changed its color from a lighter teal to a darker teal, indicating it has been selected. This brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal of drawing with the three specified colors, as it seems a reliable method for color selection has been found. The canvas remains empty, awaiting a drawing action.\\n Step 49: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [350, 500]. The canvas is currently empty. The Teal color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Teal color. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [350, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [350, 500] after selecting the Teal color swatch at the top of the page was successful. A Teal dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas. This confirms that tapping the color swatches at the top of the \\'task.html\\' page is the correct method for selecting drawing colors. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the first of the three required colors has been successfully used in the drawing.\\n Step 50: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Magenta color swatch located at the top of the page. This swatch is the middle of the three color swatches, with an approximate center at [157, 500] (bounding box [129, 434, 185, 566]). This action is intended to select Magenta as the active drawing color. The canvas currently has one Teal dot. If successful, the Magenta swatch should change appearance (e.g., become darker). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Magenta color swatch (approximate center [157, 500]) at the top of the page was successful. The Magenta swatch changed its appearance to a darker shade, and the previously selected Teal swatch reverted to its lighter shade, indicating that Magenta is now the selected drawing color. This action moves the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the second of the three required colors has been selected. The canvas still contains one Teal dot.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 51: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 500]. The canvas currently has one Teal dot at [350, 500]. The Magenta color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Magenta color. If successful, a Magenta mark will appear at [400, 500]. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,401],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clear\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Submit\\' button. The button has the text \\'Clear\\' and its bounding box is [729, 327, 765, 476]. The center is approximately [747, 401]. This action is expected to remove all drawings (the two black dots) from the canvas, leaving it blank. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clear\\' button (center approx [747, 401]) was successful. The two black dots that were previously on the canvas have been removed, and the canvas is now empty. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing a clean slate for the drawing task, fulfilling the first step of the current `PlannedNextSteps` for Subgoal 5.\\n Step 48: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,354],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color swatch located at the top of the page. The swatch is the leftmost of the three color swatches at the top, with approximate center [157, 354]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas is currently empty. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Teal color swatch at the top of the page (approximate center [157, 354]) appears to have been successful. The tapped swatch changed its color from a lighter teal to a darker teal, indicating it has been selected. This brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal of drawing with the three specified colors, as it seems a reliable method for color selection has been found. The canvas remains empty, awaiting a drawing action.\\n Step 49: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [350, 500]. The canvas is currently empty. The Teal color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Teal color. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [350, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [350, 500] after selecting the Teal color swatch at the top of the page was successful. A Teal dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas. This confirms that tapping the color swatches at the top of the \\'task.html\\' page is the correct method for selecting drawing colors. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the first of the three required colors has been successfully used in the drawing.\\n Step 50: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Magenta color swatch located at the top of the page. This swatch is the middle of the three color swatches, with an approximate center at [157, 500] (bounding box [129, 434, 185, 566]). This action is intended to select Magenta as the active drawing color. The canvas currently has one Teal dot. If successful, the Magenta swatch should change appearance (e.g., become darker). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Magenta color swatch (approximate center [157, 500]) at the top of the page was successful. The Magenta swatch changed its appearance to a darker shade, and the previously selected Teal swatch reverted to its lighter shade, indicating that Magenta is now the selected drawing color. This action moves the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the second of the three required colors has been selected. The canvas still contains one Teal dot.\\n Step 51: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 500]. The canvas currently has one Teal dot at [350, 500]. The Magenta color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Magenta color. If successful, a Magenta mark will appear at [400, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [400, 500] after selecting the Magenta color swatch was successful. A Magenta dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas, next to the existing Teal dot. This confirms that Magenta was correctly selected and can be used for drawing. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the second of the three required colors has now been successfully used in the drawing.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 132], \\'text\\': \\'17.01\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 144, 97, 755], \\'text\\': \\'0 content://com.android provider:\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [556, 363, 572, 641], \\'text\\': \\'Available Colors:\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [740, 361, 754, 445], \\'text\\': \\'Clear\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [738, 526, 755, 644], \\'text\\': \\'Submit\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [729, 328, 765, 476]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [129, 434, 185, 566]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [729, 497, 765, 673]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [670, 679, 705, 761]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [592, 239, 627, 326]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [630, 240, 666, 324]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [630, 767, 666, 848]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [129, 583, 185, 711]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [630, 679, 665, 761]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [630, 153, 666, 235]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [592, 327, 627, 410]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [592, 767, 626, 849]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [629, 328, 666, 410]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [671, 242, 705, 322]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [592, 152, 626, 236]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [671, 153, 705, 236]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [670, 768, 705, 848]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [129, 289, 185, 419]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [592, 679, 627, 761]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [592, 415, 627, 499]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [670, 592, 705, 672]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 793, 107, 874]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [630, 591, 665, 672]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [670, 330, 705, 410]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [630, 502, 666, 585]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [592, 591, 627, 672]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 896, 107, 970]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 38, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 818, 38, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [630, 417, 666, 497]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [65, 114, 108, 206]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [592, 503, 626, 584]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 902, 38, 946]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 140, 38, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [670, 417, 705, 495]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 47: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,401],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clear\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen, to the left of the \\'Submit\\' button. The button has the text \\'Clear\\' and its bounding box is [729, 327, 765, 476]. The center is approximately [747, 401]. This action is expected to remove all drawings (the two black dots) from the canvas, leaving it blank. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clear\\' button (center approx [747, 401]) was successful. The two black dots that were previously on the canvas have been removed, and the canvas is now empty. This action brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing a clean slate for the drawing task, fulfilling the first step of the current `PlannedNextSteps` for Subgoal 5.\\n Step 48: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,354],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color swatch located at the top of the page. The swatch is the leftmost of the three color swatches at the top, with approximate center [157, 354]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas is currently empty. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Teal color swatch at the top of the page (approximate center [157, 354]) appears to have been successful. The tapped swatch changed its color from a lighter teal to a darker teal, indicating it has been selected. This brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal of drawing with the three specified colors, as it seems a reliable method for color selection has been found. The canvas remains empty, awaiting a drawing action.\\n Step 49: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [350, 500]. The canvas is currently empty. The Teal color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Teal color. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [350, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [350, 500] after selecting the Teal color swatch at the top of the page was successful. A Teal dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas. This confirms that tapping the color swatches at the top of the \\'task.html\\' page is the correct method for selecting drawing colors. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the first of the three required colors has been successfully used in the drawing.\\n Step 50: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Magenta color swatch located at the top of the page. This swatch is the middle of the three color swatches, with an approximate center at [157, 500] (bounding box [129, 434, 185, 566]). This action is intended to select Magenta as the active drawing color. The canvas currently has one Teal dot. If successful, the Magenta swatch should change appearance (e.g., become darker). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Magenta color swatch (approximate center [157, 500]) at the top of the page was successful. The Magenta swatch changed its appearance to a darker shade, and the previously selected Teal swatch reverted to its lighter shade, indicating that Magenta is now the selected drawing color. This action moves the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the second of the three required colors has been selected. The canvas still contains one Teal dot.\\n Step 51: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 500]. The canvas currently has one Teal dot at [350, 500]. The Magenta color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Magenta color. If successful, a Magenta mark will appear at [400, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [400, 500] after selecting the Magenta color swatch was successful. A Magenta dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas, next to the existing Teal dot. This confirms that Magenta was correctly selected and can be used for drawing. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the second of the three required colors has now been successfully used in the drawing.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 52: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,647],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Dark Blue color swatch located at the top right of the three main color swatches. The swatch has a bounding box of [129, 583, 185, 711], and the tap will be near its center at [157, 647]. This action is intended to select Dark Blue as the active drawing color. The canvas currently has one Teal dot and one Magenta dot. If successful, the Dark Blue swatch should change appearance (e.g., become darker), and the Magenta swatch should revert to its lighter shade. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,354],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color swatch located at the top of the page. The swatch is the leftmost of the three color swatches at the top, with approximate center [157, 354]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas is currently empty. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Teal color swatch at the top of the page (approximate center [157, 354]) appears to have been successful. The tapped swatch changed its color from a lighter teal to a darker teal, indicating it has been selected. This brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal of drawing with the three specified colors, as it seems a reliable method for color selection has been found. The canvas remains empty, awaiting a drawing action.\\n Step 49: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [350, 500]. The canvas is currently empty. The Teal color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Teal color. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [350, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [350, 500] after selecting the Teal color swatch at the top of the page was successful. A Teal dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas. This confirms that tapping the color swatches at the top of the \\'task.html\\' page is the correct method for selecting drawing colors. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the first of the three required colors has been successfully used in the drawing.\\n Step 50: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Magenta color swatch located at the top of the page. This swatch is the middle of the three color swatches, with an approximate center at [157, 500] (bounding box [129, 434, 185, 566]). This action is intended to select Magenta as the active drawing color. The canvas currently has one Teal dot. If successful, the Magenta swatch should change appearance (e.g., become darker). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Magenta color swatch (approximate center [157, 500]) at the top of the page was successful. The Magenta swatch changed its appearance to a darker shade, and the previously selected Teal swatch reverted to its lighter shade, indicating that Magenta is now the selected drawing color. This action moves the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the second of the three required colors has been selected. The canvas still contains one Teal dot.\\n Step 51: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 500]. The canvas currently has one Teal dot at [350, 500]. The Magenta color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Magenta color. If successful, a Magenta mark will appear at [400, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [400, 500] after selecting the Magenta color swatch was successful. A Magenta dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas, next to the existing Teal dot. This confirms that Magenta was correctly selected and can be used for drawing. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the second of the three required colors has now been successfully used in the drawing.\\n Step 52: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,647],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Dark Blue color swatch located at the top right of the three main color swatches. The swatch has a bounding box of [129, 583, 185, 711], and the tap will be near its center at [157, 647]. This action is intended to select Dark Blue as the active drawing color. The canvas currently has one Teal dot and one Magenta dot. If successful, the Dark Blue swatch should change appearance (e.g., become darker), and the Magenta swatch should revert to its lighter shade. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Dark Blue color swatch (approximate center [157, 647]) at the top of the page was successful. The Dark Blue swatch changed its appearance to a darker shade, and the previously selected Magenta swatch reverted to its lighter shade, indicating that Dark Blue is now the selected drawing color. This action moves the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the third of the three required colors has been selected.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 48: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,354],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Teal color swatch located at the top of the page. The swatch is the leftmost of the three color swatches at the top, with approximate center [157, 354]. This action is intended to select Teal as the active drawing color. The canvas is currently empty. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Teal color swatch at the top of the page (approximate center [157, 354]) appears to have been successful. The tapped swatch changed its color from a lighter teal to a darker teal, indicating it has been selected. This brings the agent closer to completing the subgoal of drawing with the three specified colors, as it seems a reliable method for color selection has been found. The canvas remains empty, awaiting a drawing action.\\n Step 49: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [350, 500]. The canvas is currently empty. The Teal color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Teal color. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [350, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [350, 500] after selecting the Teal color swatch at the top of the page was successful. A Teal dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas. This confirms that tapping the color swatches at the top of the \\'task.html\\' page is the correct method for selecting drawing colors. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the first of the three required colors has been successfully used in the drawing.\\n Step 50: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Magenta color swatch located at the top of the page. This swatch is the middle of the three color swatches, with an approximate center at [157, 500] (bounding box [129, 434, 185, 566]). This action is intended to select Magenta as the active drawing color. The canvas currently has one Teal dot. If successful, the Magenta swatch should change appearance (e.g., become darker). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Magenta color swatch (approximate center [157, 500]) at the top of the page was successful. The Magenta swatch changed its appearance to a darker shade, and the previously selected Teal swatch reverted to its lighter shade, indicating that Magenta is now the selected drawing color. This action moves the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the second of the three required colors has been selected. The canvas still contains one Teal dot.\\n Step 51: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 500]. The canvas currently has one Teal dot at [350, 500]. The Magenta color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Magenta color. If successful, a Magenta mark will appear at [400, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [400, 500] after selecting the Magenta color swatch was successful. A Magenta dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas, next to the existing Teal dot. This confirms that Magenta was correctly selected and can be used for drawing. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the second of the three required colors has now been successfully used in the drawing.\\n Step 52: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,647],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Dark Blue color swatch located at the top right of the three main color swatches. The swatch has a bounding box of [129, 583, 185, 711], and the tap will be near its center at [157, 647]. This action is intended to select Dark Blue as the active drawing color. The canvas currently has one Teal dot and one Magenta dot. If successful, the Dark Blue swatch should change appearance (e.g., become darker), and the Magenta swatch should revert to its lighter shade. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Dark Blue color swatch (approximate center [157, 647]) at the top of the page was successful. The Dark Blue swatch changed its appearance to a darker shade, and the previously selected Magenta swatch reverted to its lighter shade, indicating that Dark Blue is now the selected drawing color. This action moves the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the third of the three required colors has been selected. The canvas still contains one Teal dot and one Magenta dot.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 53: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[450,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [450, 500]. The canvas currently has one Teal dot (at approx. [350, 500]) and one Magenta dot (at approx. [400, 500]). The Dark Blue color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Dark Blue color. If successful, a Dark Blue mark will appear at [450, 500]. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the File Manager app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app is open, its main interface is visible, and the `IdentifiedFileManagerApp` memory entry is populated with the name or description of the opened app.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The canvas is currently empty. The Teal color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Teal color. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [350, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [350, 500] after selecting the Teal color swatch at the top of the page was successful. A Teal dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas. This confirms that tapping the color swatches at the top of the \\'task.html\\' page is the correct method for selecting drawing colors. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the first of the three required colors has been successfully used in the drawing.\\n Step 50: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Magenta color swatch located at the top of the page. This swatch is the middle of the three color swatches, with an approximate center at [157, 500] (bounding box [129, 434, 185, 566]). This action is intended to select Magenta as the active drawing color. The canvas currently has one Teal dot. If successful, the Magenta swatch should change appearance (e.g., become darker). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Magenta color swatch (approximate center [157, 500]) at the top of the page was successful. The Magenta swatch changed its appearance to a darker shade, and the previously selected Teal swatch reverted to its lighter shade, indicating that Magenta is now the selected drawing color. This action moves the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the second of the three required colors has been selected. The canvas still contains one Teal dot.\\n Step 51: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Magenta color. If successful, a Magenta mark will appear at [400, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [400, 500] after selecting the Magenta color swatch was successful. A Magenta dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas, next to the existing Teal dot. This confirms that Magenta was correctly selected and can be used for drawing. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the second of the three required colors has now been successfully used in the drawing.\\n Step 52: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The swatch has a bounding box of [129, 583, 185, 711], and the tap will be near its center at [157, 647]. This action is intended to select Dark Blue as the active drawing color. The canvas currently has one Teal dot and one Magenta dot. If successful, the Dark Blue swatch should change appearance (e.g., become darker), and the Magenta swatch should revert to its lighter shade. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Dark Blue color swatch (approximate center [157, 647]) at the top of the page was successful. The Dark Blue swatch changed its appearance to a darker shade, and the previously selected Magenta swatch reverted to its lighter shade, indicating that Dark Blue is now the selected drawing color.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then create a drawing using the three colors shown at the top and hit submit.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 49: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [350, 500]. The canvas is currently empty. The Teal color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Teal color. If successful, a Teal mark will appear at [350, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [350, 500] after selecting the Teal color swatch at the top of the page was successful. A Teal dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas. This confirms that tapping the color swatches at the top of the \\'task.html\\' page is the correct method for selecting drawing colors. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the first of the three required colors has been successfully used in the drawing.\\n Step 50: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Magenta color swatch located at the top of the page. This swatch is the middle of the three color swatches, with an approximate center at [157, 500] (bounding box [129, 434, 185, 566]). This action is intended to select Magenta as the active drawing color. The canvas currently has one Teal dot. If successful, the Magenta swatch should change appearance (e.g., become darker). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Magenta color swatch (approximate center [157, 500]) at the top of the page was successful. The Magenta swatch changed its appearance to a darker shade, and the previously selected Teal swatch reverted to its lighter shade, indicating that Magenta is now the selected drawing color. This action moves the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the second of the three required colors has been selected. The canvas still contains one Teal dot.\\n Step 51: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 500]. The canvas currently has one Teal dot at [350, 500]. The Magenta color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Magenta color. If successful, a Magenta mark will appear at [400, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [400, 500] after selecting the Magenta color swatch was successful. A Magenta dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas, next to the existing Teal dot. This confirms that Magenta was correctly selected and can be used for drawing. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the second of the three required colors has now been successfully used in the drawing.\\n Step 52: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,647],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Dark Blue color swatch located at the top right of the three main color swatches. The swatch has a bounding box of [129, 583, 185, 711], and the tap will be near its center at [157, 647]. This action is intended to select Dark Blue as the active drawing color. The canvas currently has one Teal dot and one Magenta dot. If successful, the Dark Blue swatch should change appearance (e.g., become darker), and the Magenta swatch should revert to its lighter shade. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Dark Blue color swatch (approximate center [157, 647]) at the top of the page was successful. The Dark Blue swatch changed its appearance to a darker shade, and the previously selected Magenta swatch reverted to its lighter shade, indicating that Dark Blue is now the selected drawing color. This action moves the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the third of the three required colors has been selected. The canvas still contains one Teal dot and one Magenta dot.\\n Step 53: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[450,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [450, 500]. The canvas currently has one Teal dot (at approx. [350, 500]) and one Magenta dot (at approx. [400, 500]). The Dark Blue color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Dark Blue color. If successful, a Dark Blue mark will appear at [450, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [450, 500] after selecting the Dark Blue color swatch was successful. A Dark Blue dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas, next to the existing Teal and Magenta dots. This confirms that Dark Blue was correctly selected and can be used for drawing. This action completed Subgoal 5, as the third of the three required colors has now been successfully used in the drawing.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 54: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Submit\\' button. The \\'Submit\\' button is located at the bottom right of the screen, with text \\'Submit\\'. The bounding box is `[729, 497, 765, 673]`. This action is intended to submit the drawing made on the canvas. If successful, the drawing will be submitted, and the page might change or show a confirmation.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The screenshots show no change after this action. This could mean either the submission was successful without any visual feedback, or the submission failed. Given the user instruction was to 'hit submit', and the button was tapped, I will assume the submission was successful. The active Subgoal 6 was to submit the drawing. Since the 'Submit' button has been tapped, and no confirmation screen appeared (which was a possibility mentioned in the completion criteria), I will mark this subgoal as completed.
