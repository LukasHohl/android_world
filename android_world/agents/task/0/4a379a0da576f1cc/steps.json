Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[474,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the app drawer. The icon is a stylized camera and is labeled \\'Camera\\'. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe from right to left (from [900, 700] to [900, 300]) did not switch the camera to video mode. The shutter button is still a camera icon. The three icons (flash, grid, phone orientation) that were previously visible above the shutter button are now gone. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the camera to video mode. The next step is to try swiping in the opposite direction (left to right).\\n Step 105: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[799,916],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots icon located at approximately [799, 916] (center of bounding box [780, 880, 819, 953]). This action is expected to open a menu or reveal additional camera options, potentially including a way to switch to video mode. Actual Outcome: The swipe from left to right (from `[900, 250]` to `[900, 750]`) successfully revealed the camera mode selection options. The screen now displays \"Camera\" and \"Video\" options. \"Camera\" is currently selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the camera to video mode. The next step is to tap on the \"Video\" option.\\n Step 106: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,700],\"end_point\":[900,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from right to left (from [900, 700] to [900, 300]) across the lower part of the screen, near the shutter button. This action is an attempt to switch the camera mode from photo to video, as this is a common gesture in many camera applications. The current camera mode is photo, indicated by the camera shutter icon. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Video\\' option was successful. The camera app switched to video mode. The interface changed, removing the \\'Camera\\' and \\'Video\\' selection options and displaying a video record button at the bottom center. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully setting the camera to video mode.\\n Step 107: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,250],\"end_point\":[900,750],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from left to right across the screen, near the shutter button area (from `[900, 250]` to `[900, 750]`). This action is an attempt to switch the camera to video mode. The camera is currently in photo mode, as indicated by the camera shutter icon. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the video record button at [921, 498] was successful. The video recording started, which is confirmed by the record button changing to a stop button (a white square) and a timer appearing in the top left corner showing \"00:03\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording and stopping one video.\\n Step 108: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,265],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Video\\' option, which has a bounding box of `[572, 211, 589, 319]`. This action is expected to switch the camera mode from \\'Camera\\' to \\'Video\\'. The interface should update to reflect this change, possibly by highlighting \\'Video\\' and changing the shutter button to a record button. Actual Outcome: The tap on the stop recording button at [922, 501] was successful. The video recording stopped. This is confirmed by the disappearance of the timer, the change of the record button from a red stop icon to a white video camera icon, and the appearance of a video thumbnail in the bottom right corner. This action successfully completed the recording and stopping of the video, thus fulfilling the core requirement of the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[474,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the app drawer. The icon is a stylized camera and is labeled \\'Camera\\'. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe from right to left (from [900, 700] to [900, 300]) did not switch the camera to video mode. The shutter button is still a camera icon. The three icons (flash, grid, phone orientation) that were previously visible above the shutter button are now gone. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the camera to video mode. The next step is to try swiping in the opposite direction (left to right).\\n Step 105: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[799,916],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots icon located at approximately [799, 916] (center of bounding box [780, 880, 819, 953]). This action is expected to open a menu or reveal additional camera options, potentially including a way to switch to video mode. Actual Outcome: The swipe from left to right (from `[900, 250]` to `[900, 750]`) successfully revealed the camera mode selection options. The screen now displays \"Camera\" and \"Video\" options. \"Camera\" is currently selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the camera to video mode. The next step is to tap on the \"Video\" option.\\n Step 106: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,700],\"end_point\":[900,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from right to left (from [900, 700] to [900, 300]) across the lower part of the screen, near the shutter button. This action is an attempt to switch the camera mode from photo to video, as this is a common gesture in many camera applications. The current camera mode is photo, indicated by the camera shutter icon. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Video\\' option was successful. The camera app switched to video mode. The interface changed, removing the \\'Camera\\' and \\'Video\\' selection options and displaying a video record button at the bottom center. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully setting the camera to video mode.\\n Step 107: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,250],\"end_point\":[900,750],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from left to right across the screen, near the shutter button area (from `[900, 250]` to `[900, 750]`). This action is an attempt to switch the camera to video mode. The camera is currently in photo mode, as indicated by the camera shutter icon. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the video record button at [921, 498] was successful. The video recording started, which is confirmed by the record button changing to a stop button (a white square) and a timer appearing in the top left corner showing \"00:03\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording and stopping one video.\\n Step 108: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,265],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Video\\' option, which has a bounding box of `[572, 211, 589, 319]`. This action is expected to switch the camera mode from \\'Camera\\' to \\'Video\\'. The interface should update to reflect this change, possibly by highlighting \\'Video\\' and changing the shutter button to a record button. Actual Outcome: The tap on the stop recording button at [922, 501] was successful. The video recording stopped. This is confirmed by the disappearance of the timer, the change of the record button from a red stop icon to a white video camera icon, and the appearance of a video thumbnail in the bottom right corner. This action successfully completed the recording and stopping of the video, thus fulfilling the core requirement of the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 111: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[799,916],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots icon located at approximately [799, 916] (center of bounding box [780, 880, 819, 953]). This action is expected to open a menu or reveal additional camera options, potentially including a way to switch to video mode. Actual Outcome: The swipe from left to right (from `[900, 250]` to `[900, 750]`) successfully revealed the camera mode selection options. The screen now displays \"Camera\" and \"Video\" options. \"Camera\" is currently selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the camera to video mode. The next step is to tap on the \"Video\" option.\\n Step 106: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,700],\"end_point\":[900,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from right to left (from [900, 700] to [900, 300]) across the lower part of the screen, near the shutter button. This action is an attempt to switch the camera mode from photo to video, as this is a common gesture in many camera applications. The current camera mode is photo, indicated by the camera shutter icon. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Video\\' option was successful. The camera app switched to video mode. The interface changed, removing the \\'Camera\\' and \\'Video\\' selection options and displaying a video record button at the bottom center. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully setting the camera to video mode.\\n Step 107: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,250],\"end_point\":[900,750],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from left to right across the screen, near the shutter button area (from `[900, 250]` to `[900, 750]`). This action is an attempt to switch the camera to video mode. The camera is currently in photo mode, as indicated by the camera shutter icon. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the video record button at [921, 498] was successful. The video recording started, which is confirmed by the record button changing to a stop button (a white square) and a timer appearing in the top left corner showing \"00:03\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording and stopping one video.\\n Step 108: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,265],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Video\\' option, which has a bounding box of `[572, 211, 589, 319]`. This action is expected to switch the camera mode from \\'Camera\\' to \\'Video\\'. The interface should update to reflect this change, possibly by highlighting \\'Video\\' and changing the shutter button to a record button. Actual Outcome: The tap on the stop recording button at [922, 501] was successful. The video recording stopped. This is confirmed by the disappearance of the timer, the change of the record button from a red stop icon to a white video camera icon, and the appearance of a video thumbnail in the bottom right corner. This action successfully completed the recording and stopping of the video, thus fulfilling the core requirement of the active subgoal.\\n Step 109: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[921,498],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the video record button (white camcorder icon) located at the bottom center of the screen (center at approximately [921, 498]) to start recording a video. This icon is currently visible and tappable. This action is expected to start the video recording, and the icon might change to a stop button. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by completing the first subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 112: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[605,164],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Clock\" app icon located in the fifth row of the app drawer. The icon is a blue circle with a white clock hand. This action is expected to open the Clock app, which should contain the stopwatch functionality. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open App Drawer\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The app drawer is open and displaying a list of installed applications.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was successfully opened by swiping up from the bottom of the screen.\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Find and Open Stopwatch App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The stopwatch app is open.

Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is an attempt to switch the camera mode from photo to video, as this is a common gesture in many camera applications. The current camera mode is photo, indicated by the camera shutter icon. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Video\\' option was successful. The camera app switched to video mode. The interface changed, removing the \\'Camera\\' and \\'Video\\' selection options and displaying a video record button at the bottom center. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully setting the camera to video mode.\\n Step 107: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,250],\"end_point\":[900,750],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from left to right across the screen, near the shutter button area (from `[900, 250]` to `[900, 750]`). This action is an attempt to switch the camera to video mode. The camera is currently in photo mode, as indicated by the camera shutter icon. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the video record button at [921, 498] was successful. The video recording started, which is confirmed by the record button changing to a stop button (a white square) and a timer appearing in the top left corner showing \"00:03\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording and stopping one video.\\n Step 108: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,265],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Video\\' option, which has a bounding box of `[572, 211, 589, 319]`. This action is expected to switch the camera mode from \\'Camera\\' to \\'Video\\'. The interface should update to reflect this change, possibly by highlighting \\'Video\\' and changing the shutter button to a record button. Actual Outcome: The tap on the stop recording button at [922, 501] was successful. The video recording stopped. This is confirmed by the disappearance of the timer, the change of the record button from a red stop icon to a white video camera icon, and the appearance of a video thumbnail in the bottom right corner. This action successfully completed the recording and stopping of the video, thus fulfilling the core requirement of the active subgoal.\\n Step 109: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[921,498],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the video record button (white camcorder icon) located at the bottom center of the screen (center at approximately [921, 498]) to start recording a video. This icon is currently visible and tappable. This action is expected to start the video recording, and the icon might change to a stop button. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by completing the first subgoal.\\n Step 110: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[922,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the stop recording button, which is a white square icon located at the bottom center of the screen (approximate center [922, 501]). This action is expected to stop the video recording. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Clock\\' app icon was successful. The Clock app opened, displaying the current time and date. The interface changed from the app drawer to the Clock app. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the app containing the stopwatch functionality is now open. The next step is to navigate to the stopwatch section within the Clock app.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.35\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'IXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 567, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'IYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 55, 100, 208], \\'text\\': \\'Clock\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [78, 385, 95, 854], \\'text\\': \\'You can find the privacy policy here\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [164, 52, 272, 562], \\'text\\': \\'15.35 Sun, Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 51, 959, 150], \\'text\\': \\'Alarm\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [942, 250, 959, 350], \\'text\\': \\'Clock\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 450, 959, 549], \\'text\\': \\'Timer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [942, 607, 962, 971], \\'text\\': \\'Stopwatch Bedtime\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [764, 381, 869, 621]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 199, 968, 396]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 587, 967, 807]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [895, 419, 967, 575]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 808, 967, 989]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [895, 5, 972, 198]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 350, 113, 900]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 915, 110, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 821, 38, 896]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 38, 240]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

This action is an attempt to switch the camera mode from photo to video, as this is a common gesture in many camera applications. The current camera mode is photo, indicated by the camera shutter icon. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Video\\' option was successful. The camera app switched to video mode. The interface changed, removing the \\'Camera\\' and \\'Video\\' selection options and displaying a video record button at the bottom center. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully setting the camera to video mode.\\n Step 107: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,250],\"end_point\":[900,750],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from left to right across the screen, near the shutter button area (from `[900, 250]` to `[900, 750]`). This action is an attempt to switch the camera to video mode. The camera is currently in photo mode, as indicated by the camera shutter icon. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the video record button at [921, 498] was successful. The video recording started, which is confirmed by the record button changing to a stop button (a white square) and a timer appearing in the top left corner showing \"00:03\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording and stopping one video.\\n Step 108: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,265],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Video\\' option, which has a bounding box of `[572, 211, 589, 319]`. This action is expected to switch the camera mode from \\'Camera\\' to \\'Video\\'. The interface should update to reflect this change, possibly by highlighting \\'Video\\' and changing the shutter button to a record button. Actual Outcome: The tap on the stop recording button at [922, 501] was successful. The video recording stopped. This is confirmed by the disappearance of the timer, the change of the record button from a red stop icon to a white video camera icon, and the appearance of a video thumbnail in the bottom right corner. This action successfully completed the recording and stopping of the video, thus fulfilling the core requirement of the active subgoal.\\n Step 109: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[921,498],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the video record button (white camcorder icon) located at the bottom center of the screen (center at approximately [921, 498]) to start recording a video. This icon is currently visible and tappable. This action is expected to start the video recording, and the icon might change to a stop button. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by completing the first subgoal.\\n Step 110: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[922,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the stop recording button, which is a white square icon located at the bottom center of the screen (approximate center [922, 501]). This action is expected to stop the video recording. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Clock\\' app icon was successful. The Clock app opened, displaying the current time and date. The interface changed from the app drawer to the Clock app. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the app containing the stopwatch functionality is now open. The next step is to navigate to the stopwatch section within the Clock app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 113: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[932,697],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Stopwatch\\' tab, located at the bottom of the screen, to navigate to the stopwatch interface. The \\'Stopwatch\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to switch the view to the stopwatch section of the Clock app. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open App Drawer\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The app drawer is open and displaying a list of installed applications.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was successfully opened by swiping up from the bottom of the screen.\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Find and Open Stopwatch App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The stopwatch app is open and the stopwatch interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The Clock app was successfully opened by tapping its icon in the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.35\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 51, 105, 324], \\'text\\': \\'Stopwatch\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [374, 388, 492, 618], \\'text\\': \\'00 00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 51, 959, 150], \\'text\\': \\'Alarm\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 250, 959, 349], \\'text\\': \\'Clock\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [941, 447, 960, 550], \\'text\\': \\'Timer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [941, 609, 962, 971], \\'text\\': \\'Stopwatch Bedtime\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [764, 382, 870, 621]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 593, 965, 810]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [894, 198, 975, 393]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [897, 809, 964, 977]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [893, 4, 978, 199]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [897, 446, 971, 559]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 822, 36, 902]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 921, 105, 977]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is an attempt to switch the camera to video mode. The camera is currently in photo mode, as indicated by the camera shutter icon. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the video record button at [921, 498] was successful. The video recording started, which is confirmed by the record button changing to a stop button (a white square) and a timer appearing in the top left corner showing \"00:03\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording and stopping one video.\\n Step 108: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,265],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Video\\' option, which has a bounding box of `[572, 211, 589, 319]`. This action is expected to switch the camera mode from \\'Camera\\' to \\'Video\\'. The interface should update to reflect this change, possibly by highlighting \\'Video\\' and changing the shutter button to a record button. Actual Outcome: The tap on the stop recording button at [922, 501] was successful. The video recording stopped. This is confirmed by the disappearance of the timer, the change of the record button from a red stop icon to a white video camera icon, and the appearance of a video thumbnail in the bottom right corner. This action successfully completed the recording and stopping of the video, thus fulfilling the core requirement of the active subgoal.\\n Step 109: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[921,498],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the video record button (white camcorder icon) located at the bottom center of the screen (center at approximately [921, 498]) to start recording a video. This icon is currently visible and tappable. This action is expected to start the video recording, and the icon might change to a stop button. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by completing the first subgoal.\\n Step 110: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[922,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the stop recording button, which is a white square icon located at the bottom center of the screen (approximate center [922, 501]). This action is expected to stop the video recording. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Clock\\' app icon was successful. The Clock app opened, displaying the current time and date. The interface changed from the app drawer to the Clock app. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the app containing the stopwatch functionality is now open. The next step is to navigate to the stopwatch section within the Clock app.\\n Step 111: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, which contains a list of all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Stopwatch\\' tab was successful. The Clock app switched to the stopwatch interface. The \\'Stopwatch\\' tab is now selected, and the stopwatch display shows \\'00 00\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully navigating to the stopwatch section.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 114: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[817,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the play button, which is a blue circle with a triangle icon, located in the center of the screen (center at approximately [817, 501]).

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to switch the camera mode from \\'Camera\\' to \\'Video\\'. The interface should update to reflect this change, possibly by highlighting \\'Video\\' and changing the shutter button to a record button. Actual Outcome: The tap on the stop recording button at [922, 501] was successful. The video recording stopped. This is confirmed by the disappearance of the timer, the change of the record button from a red stop icon to a white video camera icon, and the appearance of a video thumbnail in the bottom right corner. This action successfully completed the recording and stopping of the video, thus fulfilling the core requirement of the active subgoal.\\n Step 109: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[921,498],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the video record button (white camcorder icon) located at the bottom center of the screen (center at approximately [921, 498]) to start recording a video. This icon is currently visible and tappable. This action is expected to start the video recording, and the icon might change to a stop button. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by completing the first subgoal.\\n Step 110: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[922,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the stop recording button, which is a white square icon located at the bottom center of the screen (approximate center [922, 501]). This action is expected to stop the video recording. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Clock\\' app icon was successful. The Clock app opened, displaying the current time and date. The interface changed from the app drawer to the Clock app. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the app containing the stopwatch functionality is now open. The next step is to navigate to the stopwatch section within the Clock app.\\n Step 111: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, which contains a list of all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Stopwatch\\' tab was successful. The Clock app switched to the stopwatch interface. The \\'Stopwatch\\' tab is now selected, and the stopwatch display shows \\'00 00\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully navigating to the stopwatch section.\\n Step 112: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[605,164],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Clock\" app icon located in the fifth row of the app drawer. The icon is a blue circle with a white clock hand. This action is expected to open the Clock app, which should contain the stopwatch functionality. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the play button at [817, 501] started the stopwatch. The stopwatch display changed from \"00 00\" to \"04 03\", and the play icon changed to a pause icon. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the stopwatch is now running instead of being paused. To correct this, the pause button needs to be tapped.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 51, 105, 324], \\'text\\': \\'Stopwatch\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [374, 393, 492, 616], \\'text\\': \\'04 03\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 51, 959, 150], \\'text\\': \\'Alarm\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 250, 959, 349], \\'text\\': \\'Clock\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [941, 447, 960, 550], \\'text\\': \\'Timer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [941, 609, 962, 971], \\'text\\': \\'Stopwatch Bedtime\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [764, 310, 870, 686]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [786, 102, 848, 247]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [897, 584, 965, 812]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [786, 752, 848, 896]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [895, 198, 971, 395]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [893, 2, 975, 200]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [897, 809, 964, 983]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [897, 412, 968, 577]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,265],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Video\\' option, which has a bounding box of `[572, 211, 589, 319]`. This action is expected to switch the camera mode from \\'Camera\\' to \\'Video\\'. The interface should update to reflect this change, possibly by highlighting \\'Video\\' and changing the shutter button to a record button. Actual Outcome: The tap on the stop recording button at [922, 501] was successful. The video recording stopped. This is confirmed by the disappearance of the timer, the change of the record button from a red stop icon to a white video camera icon, and the appearance of a video thumbnail in the bottom right corner. This action successfully completed the recording and stopping of the video, thus fulfilling the core requirement of the active subgoal.\\n Step 109: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[921,498],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the video record button (white camcorder icon) located at the bottom center of the screen (center at approximately [921, 498]) to start recording a video. This icon is currently visible and tappable. This action is expected to start the video recording, and the icon might change to a stop button. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by completing the first subgoal.\\n Step 110: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[922,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the stop recording button, which is a white square icon located at the bottom center of the screen (approximate center [922, 501]). This action is expected to stop the video recording. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Clock\\' app icon was successful. The Clock app opened, displaying the current time and date. The interface changed from the app drawer to the Clock app. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the app containing the stopwatch functionality is now open. The next step is to navigate to the stopwatch section within the Clock app.\\n Step 111: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, which contains a list of all installed applications. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Stopwatch\\' tab was successful. The Clock app switched to the stopwatch interface. The \\'Stopwatch\\' tab is now selected, and the stopwatch display shows \\'00 00\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully navigating to the stopwatch section.\\n Step 112: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[605,164],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Clock\" app icon located in the fifth row of the app drawer. The icon is a blue circle with a white clock hand. This action is expected to open the Clock app, which should contain the stopwatch functionality. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the play button at [817, 501] started the stopwatch. The stopwatch display changed from \"00 00\" to \"04 03\", and the play icon changed to a pause icon. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the stopwatch is now running instead of being paused. To correct this, the pause button needs to be tapped.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 115: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[817,498],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the pause button, which is a large blue button in the center of the screen with a pause icon. The bounding box of this button is `[764, 310, 870, 686]`. This action is expected to pause the stopwatch. The timer should stop, and the pause icon might change to a play icon. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open App Drawer\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The app drawer is open and displaying a list of installed applications.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was successfully opened by swiping up from the bottom of the screen.\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Find and Open Stopwatch App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The stopwatch app is open and the stopwatch interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The Clock app was successfully opened by tapping its icon in the app drawer.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
