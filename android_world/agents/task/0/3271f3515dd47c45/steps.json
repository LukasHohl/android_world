Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. This is the second click. This action is expected to change the number displayed on the screen. The new number will be recorded as \\'number_2\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was successful. The number displayed on the webpage changed from \\'9\\' to \\'5\\'. This signifies the completion of the third of five required clicks. The number \\'5\\' has been identified and will be stored as \\'number_3\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 89: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. The number \\'9\\' is currently displayed. Tapping the button is expected to change the displayed number. This will be the third click. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was performed. However, the number displayed on the webpage did not change from \\'5\\'. This means the number resulting from the fourth click is \\'5\\'. This number has been identified and will be stored as \\'number_4\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, as four out of five clicks have been performed and their corresponding numbers recorded.\\n Step 90: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. This is the fourth click. This action is expected to change the number displayed on the screen. The new number will be recorded as \\'number_4\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) for the fifth time was successful. Before this click, the number \\'5\\' was displayed. After the click, the \\'Click Me\\' button and the number \\'5\\' disappeared. A new section of the webpage appeared, showing an input field with placeholder text \\'Enter the product\\' and a \\'Submit\\' button. This means the fifth number to be recorded is \\'5\\'. All five numbers have now been recorded (number_1=10, number_2=9, number_3=5, number_4=5, number_5=5). This action completes Subgoal 4 and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The agent is now ready to calculate the product of the numbers.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and its associated icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file using the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was successful. The number displayed on the webpage changed from \\'9\\' to \\'10\\'. This signifies the completion of the first of five required clicks. The number \\'10\\' has been identified as \\'number_1\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which involves clicking the button five times and recording the displayed numbers.\\n Step 87: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. The number \\'9\\' is currently displayed; this will be recorded as \\'number_1\\'. Tapping the button is expected to change the displayed number. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was successful. The number displayed on the webpage changed from \\'10\\' to \\'9\\'. This signifies the completion of the second of five required clicks. The number \\'9\\' has been identified and will be stored as \\'number_2\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 88: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. This is the second click. This action is expected to change the number displayed on the screen. The new number will be recorded as \\'number_2\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was successful. The number displayed on the webpage changed from \\'9\\' to \\'5\\'. This signifies the completion of the third of five required clicks. The number \\'5\\' has been identified and will be stored as \\'number_3\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 89: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. The number \\'9\\' is currently displayed. Tapping the button is expected to change the displayed number. This will be the third click. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was performed. However, the number displayed on the webpage did not change from \\'5\\'. This means the number resulting from the fourth click is \\'5\\'. This number has been identified and will be stored as \\'number_4\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, as four out of five clicks have been performed and their corresponding numbers recorded.\\n Step 90: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. This is the fourth click. This action is expected to change the number displayed on the screen. The new number will be recorded as \\'number_4\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) for the fifth time was successful. Before this click, the number \\'5\\' was displayed. After the click, the \\'Click Me\\' button and the number \\'5\\' disappeared. A new section of the webpage appeared, showing an input field with placeholder text \\'Enter the product\\' and a \\'Submit\\' button. This means the fifth number to be recorded is \\'5\\'. All five numbers have now been recorded (number_1=10, number_2=9, number_3=5, number_4=5, number_5=5). This action completes Subgoal 4 and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The agent is now ready to calculate the product of the numbers.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 93: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 89: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. The number \\'9\\' is currently displayed. Tapping the button is expected to change the displayed number. This will be the third click. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was performed. However, the number displayed on the webpage did not change from \\'5\\'. This means the number resulting from the fourth click is \\'5\\'. This number has been identified and will be stored as \\'number_4\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, as four out of five clicks have been performed and their corresponding numbers recorded.\\n Step 90: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. This is the fourth click. This action is expected to change the number displayed on the screen. The new number will be recorded as \\'number_4\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) for the fifth time was successful. Before this click, the number \\'5\\' was displayed. After the click, the \\'Click Me\\' button and the number \\'5\\' disappeared. A new section of the webpage appeared, showing an input field with placeholder text \\'Enter the product\\' and a \\'Submit\\' button. This means the fifth number to be recorded is \\'5\\'. All five numbers have now been recorded (number_1=10, number_2=9, number_3=5, number_4=5, number_5=5). This action completes Subgoal 4 and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The agent is now ready to calculate the product of the numbers.\\n Step 91: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. The number \\'5\\' is currently displayed. Tapping the button is expected to change the displayed number. This will be the fifth click. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the Camera app icon in the app drawer at `[514, 392]` did not open the Camera app. Instead, it closed the app drawer and returned to the home screen. The Camera app is now visible on the home screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 712, 65, 797], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 46, 147, 306], \\'text\\': \\'Sun; Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 336, 722, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Gmail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 561, 722, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [704, 781, 722, 921], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [775, 295, 872, 709], \\'text\\': \\'0 (9\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 72, 855, 232]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 765, 856, 929]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 536, 729, 695]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 535, 858, 706]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 299, 856, 466]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 764, 729, 927]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 299, 730, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 701, 948, 795]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [892, 801, 952, 925]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 823, 40, 900]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. This is the second click. This action is expected to change the number displayed on the screen. The new number will be recorded as \\'number_2\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was successful. The number displayed on the webpage changed from \\'9\\' to \\'5\\'. This signifies the completion of the third of five required clicks. The number \\'5\\' has been identified and will be stored as \\'number_3\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 89: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. The number \\'9\\' is currently displayed. Tapping the button is expected to change the displayed number. This will be the third click. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was performed. However, the number displayed on the webpage did not change from \\'5\\'. This means the number resulting from the fourth click is \\'5\\'. This number has been identified and will be stored as \\'number_4\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, as four out of five clicks have been performed and their corresponding numbers recorded.\\n Step 90: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. This is the fourth click. This action is expected to change the number displayed on the screen. The new number will be recorded as \\'number_4\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) for the fifth time was successful. Before this click, the number \\'5\\' was displayed. After the click, the \\'Click Me\\' button and the number \\'5\\' disappeared. A new section of the webpage appeared, showing an input field with placeholder text \\'Enter the product\\' and a \\'Submit\\' button. This means the fifth number to be recorded is \\'5\\'. All five numbers have now been recorded (number_1=10, number_2=9, number_3=5, number_4=5, number_5=5). This action completes Subgoal 4 and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The agent is now ready to calculate the product of the numbers.\\n Step 91: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. The number \\'5\\' is currently displayed. Tapping the button is expected to change the displayed number. This will be the fifth click. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the Camera app icon in the app drawer at `[514, 392]` did not open the Camera app. Instead, it closed the app drawer and returned to the home screen. The Camera app is now visible on the home screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 92: Action: {\"name\":\"If the task requires it, use this to send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"product_of_numbers = 11250\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Calculate the product of the five numbers (10 * 9 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 11250) and store it in memory as \\'product_of_numbers\\'. This action does not interact with the screen. The predicted outcome is that the \\'product_of_numbers\\' variable in memory will be updated to \\'11250\\', and the active subgoal will change to Subgoal 6: \\'Enter the product into the form\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the icon at `[922,863]` resulted in opening the Google Lens app, not the Camera app as intended. This means the tapped icon was for Google Lens. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 95: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close Google Lens and return to the previous screen (likely the home screen).

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. The number \\'9\\' is currently displayed. Tapping the button is expected to change the displayed number. This will be the third click. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was performed. However, the number displayed on the webpage did not change from \\'5\\'. This means the number resulting from the fourth click is \\'5\\'. This number has been identified and will be stored as \\'number_4\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, as four out of five clicks have been performed and their corresponding numbers recorded.\\n Step 90: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. This is the fourth click. This action is expected to change the number displayed on the screen. The new number will be recorded as \\'number_4\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) for the fifth time was successful. Before this click, the number \\'5\\' was displayed. After the click, the \\'Click Me\\' button and the number \\'5\\' disappeared. A new section of the webpage appeared, showing an input field with placeholder text \\'Enter the product\\' and a \\'Submit\\' button. This means the fifth number to be recorded is \\'5\\'. All five numbers have now been recorded (number_1=10, number_2=9, number_3=5, number_4=5, number_5=5). This action completes Subgoal 4 and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The agent is now ready to calculate the product of the numbers.\\n Step 91: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. The number \\'5\\' is currently displayed. Tapping the button is expected to change the displayed number. This will be the fifth click. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the Camera app icon in the app drawer at `[514, 392]` did not open the Camera app. Instead, it closed the app drawer and returned to the home screen. The Camera app is now visible on the home screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 92: Action: {\"name\":\"If the task requires it, use this to send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"product_of_numbers = 11250\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Calculate the product of the five numbers (10 * 9 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 11250) and store it in memory as \\'product_of_numbers\\'. This action does not interact with the screen. The predicted outcome is that the \\'product_of_numbers\\' variable in memory will be updated to \\'11250\\', and the active subgoal will change to Subgoal 6: \\'Enter the product into the form\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the icon at `[922,863]` resulted in opening the Google Lens app, not the Camera app as intended. This means the tapped icon was for Google Lens. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 93: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[514,392],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the middle of the screen. The icon is a stylized camera. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) was successful. Google Lens, which was visible in the first screenshot, was closed, and the device returned to the home screen, as shown in the second screenshot. This action corrected the error from the previous step but did not directly progress towards opening the Camera app, other than returning to a state where another attempt can be made.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.35\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 712, 65, 797], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 46, 147, 306], \\'text\\': \\'Sun; Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 336, 722, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Gmail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 561, 722, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [704, 781, 722, 921], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [775, 295, 872, 709], \\'text\\': \\'0 (9\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 72, 855, 232]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 765, 856, 929]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 535, 858, 706]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 299, 856, 466]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 537, 729, 694]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 764, 728, 927]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 299, 730, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 701, 948, 795]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [893, 802, 953, 918]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 822, 39, 900]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. The number \\'9\\' is currently displayed. Tapping the button is expected to change the displayed number. This will be the third click. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was performed. However, the number displayed on the webpage did not change from \\'5\\'. This means the number resulting from the fourth click is \\'5\\'. This number has been identified and will be stored as \\'number_4\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, as four out of five clicks have been performed and their corresponding numbers recorded.\\n Step 90: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. This is the fourth click. This action is expected to change the number displayed on the screen. The new number will be recorded as \\'number_4\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) for the fifth time was successful. Before this click, the number \\'5\\' was displayed. After the click, the \\'Click Me\\' button and the number \\'5\\' disappeared. A new section of the webpage appeared, showing an input field with placeholder text \\'Enter the product\\' and a \\'Submit\\' button. This means the fifth number to be recorded is \\'5\\'. All five numbers have now been recorded (number_1=10, number_2=9, number_3=5, number_4=5, number_5=5). This action completes Subgoal 4 and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The agent is now ready to calculate the product of the numbers.\\n Step 91: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. The number \\'5\\' is currently displayed. Tapping the button is expected to change the displayed number. This will be the fifth click. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the Camera app icon in the app drawer at `[514, 392]` did not open the Camera app. Instead, it closed the app drawer and returned to the home screen. The Camera app is now visible on the home screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 92: Action: {\"name\":\"If the task requires it, use this to send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"product_of_numbers = 11250\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Calculate the product of the five numbers (10 * 9 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 11250) and store it in memory as \\'product_of_numbers\\'. This action does not interact with the screen. The predicted outcome is that the \\'product_of_numbers\\' variable in memory will be updated to \\'11250\\', and the active subgoal will change to Subgoal 6: \\'Enter the product into the form\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the icon at `[922,863]` resulted in opening the Google Lens app, not the Camera app as intended. This means the tapped icon was for Google Lens. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 93: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[514,392],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the middle of the screen. The icon is a stylized camera. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) was successful. Google Lens, which was visible in the first screenshot, was closed, and the device returned to the home screen, as shown in the second screenshot. This action corrected the error from the previous step but did not directly progress towards opening the Camera app, other than returning to a state where another attempt can be made.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 96: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [400, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the Camera app icon can be located. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Camera App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Camera app is open and the camera view is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Tapped on the Camera app icon in the app drawer, but it closed the app drawer and returned to the home screen.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is the fourth click. This action is expected to change the number displayed on the screen. The new number will be recorded as \\'number_4\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) for the fifth time was successful. Before this click, the number \\'5\\' was displayed. After the click, the \\'Click Me\\' button and the number \\'5\\' disappeared. A new section of the webpage appeared, showing an input field with placeholder text \\'Enter the product\\' and a \\'Submit\\' button. This means the fifth number to be recorded is \\'5\\'. All five numbers have now been recorded (number_1=10, number_2=9, number_3=5, number_4=5, number_5=5). This action completes Subgoal 4 and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The agent is now ready to calculate the product of the numbers.\\n Step 91: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. The number \\'5\\' is currently displayed. Tapping the button is expected to change the displayed number. This will be the fifth click. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the Camera app icon in the app drawer at `[514, 392]` did not open the Camera app. Instead, it closed the app drawer and returned to the home screen. The Camera app is now visible on the home screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 92: Action: {\"name\":\"If the task requires it, use this to send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"product_of_numbers = 11250\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Calculate the product of the five numbers (10 * 9 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 11250) and store it in memory as \\'product_of_numbers\\'. This action does not interact with the screen. The predicted outcome is that the \\'product_of_numbers\\' variable in memory will be updated to \\'11250\\', and the active subgoal will change to Subgoal 6: \\'Enter the product into the form\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the icon at `[922,863]` resulted in opening the Google Lens app, not the Camera app as intended. This means the tapped icon was for Google Lens. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 93: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[514,392],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the middle of the screen. The icon is a stylized camera. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) was successful. Google Lens, which was visible in the first screenshot, was closed, and the device returned to the home screen, as shown in the second screenshot. This action corrected the error from the previous step but did not directly progress towards opening the Camera app, other than returning to a state where another attempt can be made.\\n Step 94: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[922,863],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which has a bounding box of `[892, 801, 952, 925]`. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing numerous app icons. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. This is the fourth click. This action is expected to change the number displayed on the screen. The new number will be recorded as \\'number_4\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) for the fifth time was successful. Before this click, the number \\'5\\' was displayed. After the click, the \\'Click Me\\' button and the number \\'5\\' disappeared. A new section of the webpage appeared, showing an input field with placeholder text \\'Enter the product\\' and a \\'Submit\\' button. This means the fifth number to be recorded is \\'5\\'. All five numbers have now been recorded (number_1=10, number_2=9, number_3=5, number_4=5, number_5=5). This action completes Subgoal 4 and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The agent is now ready to calculate the product of the numbers.\\n Step 91: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. The number \\'5\\' is currently displayed. Tapping the button is expected to change the displayed number. This will be the fifth click. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the Camera app icon in the app drawer at `[514, 392]` did not open the Camera app. Instead, it closed the app drawer and returned to the home screen. The Camera app is now visible on the home screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 92: Action: {\"name\":\"If the task requires it, use this to send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"product_of_numbers = 11250\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Calculate the product of the five numbers (10 * 9 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 11250) and store it in memory as \\'product_of_numbers\\'. This action does not interact with the screen. The predicted outcome is that the \\'product_of_numbers\\' variable in memory will be updated to \\'11250\\', and the active subgoal will change to Subgoal 6: \\'Enter the product into the form\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the icon at `[922,863]` resulted in opening the Google Lens app, not the Camera app as intended. This means the tapped icon was for Google Lens. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 93: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[514,392],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the middle of the screen. The icon is a stylized camera. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) was successful. Google Lens, which was visible in the first screenshot, was closed, and the device returned to the home screen, as shown in the second screenshot. This action corrected the error from the previous step but did not directly progress towards opening the Camera app, other than returning to a state where another attempt can be made.\\n Step 94: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[922,863],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which has a bounding box of `[892, 801, 952, 925]`. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing numerous app icons. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 97: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[474,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the icon at `[922,863]` resulted in opening the Google Lens app, not the Camera app as intended. This means the tapped icon was for Google Lens. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 93: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[514,392],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the middle of the screen. The icon is a stylized camera. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) was successful. Google Lens, which was visible in the first screenshot, was closed, and the device returned to the home screen, as shown in the second screenshot. This action corrected the error from the previous step but did not directly progress towards opening the Camera app, other than returning to a state where another attempt can be made.\\n Step 94: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[922,863],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which has a bounding box of `[892, 801, 952, 925]`. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing numerous app icons. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 95: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close Google Lens and return to the previous screen (likely the home screen). This will allow me to attempt to open the Camera app again. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Camera app icon at [474,393] in the app drawer was successful. The Camera app launched, and the screen now displays the camera\\'s viewfinder and controls. This completes the subgoal of opening the Camera app and moves the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction to take a photo.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 67, 77], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [55, 141, 65, 222], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \"\\\\\\'dX: 0.0\"}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 325, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 465, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'ISize: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 27, 88, 204], \\'text\\': \\'MODE LIST\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 255, 87, 432], \\'text\\': \\'FILMSTRIP\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 546, 87, 582], \\'text\\': \\'Z\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 757, 87, 800], \\'text\\': \\'Z+\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [65, 7, 100, 223]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 810, 40, 953]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [64, 236, 100, 451]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [886, 449, 926, 552]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [62, 679, 100, 878]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [64, 464, 100, 665]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. The number \\'5\\' is currently displayed. Tapping the button is expected to change the displayed number. This will be the fifth click. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the Camera app icon in the app drawer at `[514, 392]` did not open the Camera app. Instead, it closed the app drawer and returned to the home screen. The Camera app is now visible on the home screen. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 92: Action: {\"name\":\"If the task requires it, use this to send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"product_of_numbers = 11250\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Calculate the product of the five numbers (10 * 9 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 11250) and store it in memory as \\'product_of_numbers\\'. This action does not interact with the screen. The predicted outcome is that the \\'product_of_numbers\\' variable in memory will be updated to \\'11250\\', and the active subgoal will change to Subgoal 6: \\'Enter the product into the form\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the icon at `[922,863]` resulted in opening the Google Lens app, not the Camera app as intended. This means the tapped icon was for Google Lens. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 93: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[514,392],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the middle of the screen. The icon is a stylized camera. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) was successful. Google Lens, which was visible in the first screenshot, was closed, and the device returned to the home screen, as shown in the second screenshot. This action corrected the error from the previous step but did not directly progress towards opening the Camera app, other than returning to a state where another attempt can be made.\\n Step 94: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[922,863],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which has a bounding box of `[892, 801, 952, 925]`. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing numerous app icons. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 95: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close Google Lens and return to the previous screen (likely the home screen).

UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
        "response": "{'ScreenshotDifferenceObservation': 'The screenshot before and after the action are very similar. The main difference is that the camera icon on the left side of the screen, which was present in the first screenshot, is no longer visible in the second screenshot.

The screenshot comparison shows that the camera icon on the left side of the screen disappeared after the action. This is a common UI change after taking a photo in some camera apps. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the photo was successfully taken. The active subgoal is 'Take Photo'.
