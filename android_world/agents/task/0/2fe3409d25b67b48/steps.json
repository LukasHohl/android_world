Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the large white circular button located at the bottom center of the screen (approximate center [911, 500]) to start the audio recording. This button is currently not active (not recording). Tapping it is expected to start the recording process, and the timer \\'00:00\\' should begin counting up. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the record button at [911, 500] was successful. The audio recording started, as indicated by the timer changing from \"00:00\" to \"00:01\", the appearance of the text \"Recording...\", and the change in the central button from a record icon to a pause icon. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Makes the agent wait for 10 seconds. Use this if a page is not loaded.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Wait for 10 seconds to allow the audio recording to capture some sound. This is a planned step before stopping the recording. The screen currently shows the recording in progress. Actual Outcome: The \\'wait for 10 seconds\\' action was successful. The audio recording continued, and the timer advanced from \\'00:01\\' to \\'00:47\\'. The screen shows \\'Recording...\\' and the file size has increased from 0.01 Mb to 0.52 Mb. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing sufficient time for the recording. The next step is to stop the recording.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the pause button (currently showing \\'||\\' icon) located at the bottom center of the screen, with bounding box [883, 433, 939, 565]. Tapping this button is expected to stop the audio recording. The timer should stop, and the UI should change to reflect that the recording has ended, likely presenting options to save or discard the recording. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the pause button at [911, 500] was successful in changing the state of the recording. The recording transitioned from \\'Recording...\\' to \\'Paused\\'. The timer shows \\'01:19\\', and the central button now displays \\'REC\\'. This action did not fully \\'stop\\' the recording in the sense of finalizing it, but rather paused it. To complete the subgoal of stopping the recording, the next step should be to tap the save/done/checkmark icon.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[913,689],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the square icon (likely save/done) located to the right of the \\'REC\\' button. The icon\\'s bounding box is [886, 642, 941, 737], and the tap will be at its approximate center [913, 689]. This action is expected to stop and finalize the current audio recording, moving to the next step of saving it. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the save/done icon (located at [913, 689] in the previous screen) successfully stopped the audio recording. A \\'New name\\' dialog appeared, prompting for a filename (defaulting to \\'Record-1\\') and providing \\'Cancel\\' and \\'Save\\' options. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by successfully stopping the recording and initiating the save process.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,759],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom right of the \\'New name\\' dialog. The button\\'s bounding box is [537, 647, 595, 871]. Tapping this button is expected to save the audio recording with the name \\'Record-1\\' and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Save\\' button (located at [566, 759] in the \\'New name\\' dialog) was successful. The \\'New name\\' dialog closed, and the application returned to the main screen of the Audio Recorder. The recording named \"Record-1\" is now visible on the main screen below the timer, confirming that the save operation was completed. This action successfully completed Subgoal 3.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 712, 65, 797], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 46, 147, 306], \\'text\\': \\'Sun; Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 336, 722, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Gmail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 561, 722, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [704, 781, 722, 921], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [775, 295, 872, 709], \\'text\\': \\'0 (9\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 72, 855, 232]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 765, 856, 929]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 536, 729, 694]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 535, 858, 706]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 299, 856, 466]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 764, 729, 928]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 300, 730, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 701, 948, 795]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [892, 800, 952, 925]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 823, 40, 900]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the large white circular button located at the bottom center of the screen (approximate center [911, 500]) to start the audio recording. This button is currently not active (not recording). Tapping it is expected to start the recording process, and the timer \\'00:00\\' should begin counting up. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the record button at [911, 500] was successful. The audio recording started, as indicated by the timer changing from \"00:00\" to \"00:01\", the appearance of the text \"Recording...\", and the change in the central button from a record icon to a pause icon. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Makes the agent wait for 10 seconds. Use this if a page is not loaded.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Wait for 10 seconds to allow the audio recording to capture some sound. This is a planned step before stopping the recording. The screen currently shows the recording in progress. Actual Outcome: The \\'wait for 10 seconds\\' action was successful. The audio recording continued, and the timer advanced from \\'00:01\\' to \\'00:47\\'. The screen shows \\'Recording...\\' and the file size has increased from 0.01 Mb to 0.52 Mb. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing sufficient time for the recording. The next step is to stop the recording.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the pause button (currently showing \\'||\\' icon) located at the bottom center of the screen, with bounding box [883, 433, 939, 565]. Tapping this button is expected to stop the audio recording. The timer should stop, and the UI should change to reflect that the recording has ended, likely presenting options to save or discard the recording. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the pause button at [911, 500] was successful in changing the state of the recording. The recording transitioned from \\'Recording...\\' to \\'Paused\\'. The timer shows \\'01:19\\', and the central button now displays \\'REC\\'. This action did not fully \\'stop\\' the recording in the sense of finalizing it, but rather paused it. To complete the subgoal of stopping the recording, the next step should be to tap the save/done/checkmark icon.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[913,689],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the square icon (likely save/done) located to the right of the \\'REC\\' button. The icon\\'s bounding box is [886, 642, 941, 737], and the tap will be at its approximate center [913, 689]. This action is expected to stop and finalize the current audio recording, moving to the next step of saving it. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the save/done icon (located at [913, 689] in the previous screen) successfully stopped the audio recording. A \\'New name\\' dialog appeared, prompting for a filename (defaulting to \\'Record-1\\') and providing \\'Cancel\\' and \\'Save\\' options. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by successfully stopping the recording and initiating the save process.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,759],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom right of the \\'New name\\' dialog. The button\\'s bounding box is [537, 647, 595, 871]. Tapping this button is expected to save the audio recording with the name \\'Record-1\\' and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Save\\' button (located at [566, 759] in the \\'New name\\' dialog) was successful. The \\'New name\\' dialog closed, and the application returned to the main screen of the Audio Recorder. The recording named \"Record-1\" is now visible on the main screen below the timer, confirming that the save operation was completed. This action successfully completed Subgoal 3.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,540],\"end_point\":[300,540],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (approximately [900, 540]) to the upper-middle of the screen (approximately [300, 540]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the \\'Audio Recorder\\' app can be searched for.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use this if a page is not loaded.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Wait for 10 seconds to allow the audio recording to capture some sound. This is a planned step before stopping the recording. The screen currently shows the recording in progress. Actual Outcome: The \\'wait for 10 seconds\\' action was successful. The audio recording continued, and the timer advanced from \\'00:01\\' to \\'00:47\\'. The screen shows \\'Recording...\\' and the file size has increased from 0.01 Mb to 0.52 Mb. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing sufficient time for the recording. The next step is to stop the recording.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the pause button (currently showing \\'||\\' icon) located at the bottom center of the screen, with bounding box [883, 433, 939, 565]. Tapping this button is expected to stop the audio recording. The timer should stop, and the UI should change to reflect that the recording has ended, likely presenting options to save or discard the recording. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the pause button at [911, 500] was successful in changing the state of the recording. The recording transitioned from \\'Recording...\\' to \\'Paused\\'. The timer shows \\'01:19\\', and the central button now displays \\'REC\\'. This action did not fully \\'stop\\' the recording in the sense of finalizing it, but rather paused it. To complete the subgoal of stopping the recording, the next step should be to tap the save/done/checkmark icon.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[913,689],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the square icon (likely save/done) located to the right of the \\'REC\\' button. The icon\\'s bounding box is [886, 642, 941, 737], and the tap will be at its approximate center [913, 689]. This action is expected to stop and finalize the current audio recording, moving to the next step of saving it. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the save/done icon (located at [913, 689] in the previous screen) successfully stopped the audio recording. A \\'New name\\' dialog appeared, prompting for a filename (defaulting to \\'Record-1\\') and providing \\'Cancel\\' and \\'Save\\' options. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by successfully stopping the recording and initiating the save process.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,759],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom right of the \\'New name\\' dialog. The button\\'s bounding box is [537, 647, 595, 871]. Tapping this button is expected to save the audio recording with the name \\'Record-1\\' and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Save\\' button (located at [566, 759] in the \\'New name\\' dialog) was successful. The \\'New name\\' dialog closed, and the application returned to the main screen of the Audio Recorder. The recording named \"Record-1\" is now visible on the main screen below the timer, confirming that the save operation was completed. This action successfully completed Subgoal 3.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,540],\"end_point\":[300,540],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (approximately [900, 540]) to the upper-middle of the screen (approximately [300, 540]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the \\'Audio Recorder\\' app can be searched for. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing a grid of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Audio Recorder\\' app, as the app drawer is where the app is expected to be found.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use this if a page is not loaded.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Wait for 10 seconds to allow the audio recording to capture some sound. This is a planned step before stopping the recording. The screen currently shows the recording in progress. Actual Outcome: The \\'wait for 10 seconds\\' action was successful. The audio recording continued, and the timer advanced from \\'00:01\\' to \\'00:47\\'. The screen shows \\'Recording...\\' and the file size has increased from 0.01 Mb to 0.52 Mb. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing sufficient time for the recording. The next step is to stop the recording.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the pause button (currently showing \\'||\\' icon) located at the bottom center of the screen, with bounding box [883, 433, 939, 565]. Tapping this button is expected to stop the audio recording. The timer should stop, and the UI should change to reflect that the recording has ended, likely presenting options to save or discard the recording. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the pause button at [911, 500] was successful in changing the state of the recording. The recording transitioned from \\'Recording...\\' to \\'Paused\\'. The timer shows \\'01:19\\', and the central button now displays \\'REC\\'. This action did not fully \\'stop\\' the recording in the sense of finalizing it, but rather paused it. To complete the subgoal of stopping the recording, the next step should be to tap the save/done/checkmark icon.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[913,689],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the square icon (likely save/done) located to the right of the \\'REC\\' button. The icon\\'s bounding box is [886, 642, 941, 737], and the tap will be at its approximate center [913, 689]. This action is expected to stop and finalize the current audio recording, moving to the next step of saving it. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the save/done icon (located at [913, 689] in the previous screen) successfully stopped the audio recording. A \\'New name\\' dialog appeared, prompting for a filename (defaulting to \\'Record-1\\') and providing \\'Cancel\\' and \\'Save\\' options. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by successfully stopping the recording and initiating the save process.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,759],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom right of the \\'New name\\' dialog. The button\\'s bounding box is [537, 647, 595, 871]. Tapping this button is expected to save the audio recording with the name \\'Record-1\\' and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Save\\' button (located at [566, 759] in the \\'New name\\' dialog) was successful. The \\'New name\\' dialog closed, and the application returned to the main screen of the Audio Recorder. The recording named \"Record-1\" is now visible on the main screen below the timer, confirming that the save operation was completed. This action successfully completed Subgoal 3.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,540],\"end_point\":[300,540],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (approximately [900, 540]) to the upper-middle of the screen (approximately [300, 540]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the \\'Audio Recorder\\' app can be searched for. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing a grid of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Audio Recorder\\' app, as the app drawer is where the app is expected to be found.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[342,400],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Audio Recor...\\' app icon (approximate bounding box [291, 295, 393, 506]) at its center [342, 400] to open the Audio Recorder app. This action is expected to launch the app and display its main interface.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the pause button (currently showing \\'||\\' icon) located at the bottom center of the screen, with bounding box [883, 433, 939, 565]. Tapping this button is expected to stop the audio recording. The timer should stop, and the UI should change to reflect that the recording has ended, likely presenting options to save or discard the recording. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the pause button at [911, 500] was successful in changing the state of the recording. The recording transitioned from \\'Recording...\\' to \\'Paused\\'. The timer shows \\'01:19\\', and the central button now displays \\'REC\\'. This action did not fully \\'stop\\' the recording in the sense of finalizing it, but rather paused it. To complete the subgoal of stopping the recording, the next step should be to tap the save/done/checkmark icon.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[913,689],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the square icon (likely save/done) located to the right of the \\'REC\\' button. The icon\\'s bounding box is [886, 642, 941, 737], and the tap will be at its approximate center [913, 689]. This action is expected to stop and finalize the current audio recording, moving to the next step of saving it. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the save/done icon (located at [913, 689] in the previous screen) successfully stopped the audio recording. A \\'New name\\' dialog appeared, prompting for a filename (defaulting to \\'Record-1\\') and providing \\'Cancel\\' and \\'Save\\' options. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by successfully stopping the recording and initiating the save process.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,759],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom right of the \\'New name\\' dialog. The button\\'s bounding box is [537, 647, 595, 871]. Tapping this button is expected to save the audio recording with the name \\'Record-1\\' and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Save\\' button (located at [566, 759] in the \\'New name\\' dialog) was successful. The \\'New name\\' dialog closed, and the application returned to the main screen of the Audio Recorder. The recording named \"Record-1\" is now visible on the main screen below the timer, confirming that the save operation was completed. This action successfully completed Subgoal 3.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,540],\"end_point\":[300,540],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (approximately [900, 540]) to the upper-middle of the screen (approximately [300, 540]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the \\'Audio Recorder\\' app can be searched for. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing a grid of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Audio Recorder\\' app, as the app drawer is where the app is expected to be found.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[342,400],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Audio Recor...\\' app icon (approximate bounding box [291, 295, 393, 506]) at its center [342, 400] to open the Audio Recorder app. This action is expected to launch the app and display its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Audio Recor...\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Audio Recorder\\' app opened and is now displaying its welcome screen. This action completed Subgoal 1, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [340, 323, 410, 683], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \\\\\\'\"I\\\\\\'}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [466, 205, 503, 804], \\'text\\': \\'Audio Recorder\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [517, 118, 583, 887], \\'text\\': \\'Welcome to a simple and fast application\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [887, 405, 903, 595], \\'text\\': \\'Get started\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [869, 327, 922, 675]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 819, 41, 896]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nRecord an audio clip and save it with name \"presentation_fGwr.m4a\" using Audio Recorder app.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the pause button (currently showing \\'||\\' icon) located at the bottom center of the screen, with bounding box [883, 433, 939, 565]. Tapping this button is expected to stop the audio recording. The timer should stop, and the UI should change to reflect that the recording has ended, likely presenting options to save or discard the recording. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the pause button at [911, 500] was successful in changing the state of the recording. The recording transitioned from \\'Recording...\\' to \\'Paused\\'. The timer shows \\'01:19\\', and the central button now displays \\'REC\\'. This action did not fully \\'stop\\' the recording in the sense of finalizing it, but rather paused it. To complete the subgoal of stopping the recording, the next step should be to tap the save/done/checkmark icon.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[913,689],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the square icon (likely save/done) located to the right of the \\'REC\\' button. The icon\\'s bounding box is [886, 642, 941, 737], and the tap will be at its approximate center [913, 689]. This action is expected to stop and finalize the current audio recording, moving to the next step of saving it. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the save/done icon (located at [913, 689] in the previous screen) successfully stopped the audio recording. A \\'New name\\' dialog appeared, prompting for a filename (defaulting to \\'Record-1\\') and providing \\'Cancel\\' and \\'Save\\' options. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by successfully stopping the recording and initiating the save process.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,759],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom right of the \\'New name\\' dialog. The button\\'s bounding box is [537, 647, 595, 871]. Tapping this button is expected to save the audio recording with the name \\'Record-1\\' and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Save\\' button (located at [566, 759] in the \\'New name\\' dialog) was successful. The \\'New name\\' dialog closed, and the application returned to the main screen of the Audio Recorder. The recording named \"Record-1\" is now visible on the main screen below the timer, confirming that the save operation was completed. This action successfully completed Subgoal 3.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,540],\"end_point\":[300,540],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (approximately [900, 540]) to the upper-middle of the screen (approximately [300, 540]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the \\'Audio Recorder\\' app can be searched for. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing a grid of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Audio Recorder\\' app, as the app drawer is where the app is expected to be found.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[342,400],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Audio Recor...\\' app icon (approximate bounding box [291, 295, 393, 506]) at its center [342, 400] to open the Audio Recorder app. This action is expected to launch the app and display its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Audio Recor...\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Audio Recorder\\' app opened and is now displaying its welcome screen. This action completed Subgoal 1, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[895,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Get started\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom of the screen. The button\\'s bounding box is [869, 327, 922, 675]. Tapping this button is expected to take the user to the main screen of the audio recorder, where the recording can be started.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[913,689],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the square icon (likely save/done) located to the right of the \\'REC\\' button. The icon\\'s bounding box is [886, 642, 941, 737], and the tap will be at its approximate center [913, 689]. This action is expected to stop and finalize the current audio recording, moving to the next step of saving it. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the save/done icon (located at [913, 689] in the previous screen) successfully stopped the audio recording. A \\'New name\\' dialog appeared, prompting for a filename (defaulting to \\'Record-1\\') and providing \\'Cancel\\' and \\'Save\\' options. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by successfully stopping the recording and initiating the save process.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,759],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom right of the \\'New name\\' dialog. The button\\'s bounding box is [537, 647, 595, 871]. Tapping this button is expected to save the audio recording with the name \\'Record-1\\' and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Save\\' button (located at [566, 759] in the \\'New name\\' dialog) was successful. The \\'New name\\' dialog closed, and the application returned to the main screen of the Audio Recorder. The recording named \"Record-1\" is now visible on the main screen below the timer, confirming that the save operation was completed. This action successfully completed Subgoal 3.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,540],\"end_point\":[300,540],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (approximately [900, 540]) to the upper-middle of the screen (approximately [300, 540]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the \\'Audio Recorder\\' app can be searched for. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing a grid of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Audio Recorder\\' app, as the app drawer is where the app is expected to be found.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[342,400],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Audio Recor...\\' app icon (approximate bounding box [291, 295, 393, 506]) at its center [342, 400] to open the Audio Recorder app. This action is expected to launch the app and display its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Audio Recor...\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Audio Recorder\\' app opened and is now displaying its welcome screen. This action completed Subgoal 1, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[895,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Get started\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom of the screen. The button\\'s bounding box is [869, 327, 922, 675]. Tapping this button is expected to take the user to the main screen of the audio recorder, where the recording can be started. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Get started\\' button (located at [895, 501] in the previous screen) was successful. The application navigated from the welcome screen to the \\'Setup\\' screen. This screen presents various configuration options for audio recording and has \\'Reset\\' and \\'Apply\\' buttons at the bottom. This action brought the agent closer to starting a recording by progressing through the app\\'s initial setup.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[913,689],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the square icon (likely save/done) located to the right of the \\'REC\\' button. The icon\\'s bounding box is [886, 642, 941, 737], and the tap will be at its approximate center [913, 689]. This action is expected to stop and finalize the current audio recording, moving to the next step of saving it. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the save/done icon (located at [913, 689] in the previous screen) successfully stopped the audio recording. A \\'New name\\' dialog appeared, prompting for a filename (defaulting to \\'Record-1\\') and providing \\'Cancel\\' and \\'Save\\' options. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the overall user instruction by successfully stopping the recording and initiating the save process.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,759],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom right of the \\'New name\\' dialog. The button\\'s bounding box is [537, 647, 595, 871]. Tapping this button is expected to save the audio recording with the name \\'Record-1\\' and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Save\\' button (located at [566, 759] in the \\'New name\\' dialog) was successful. The \\'New name\\' dialog closed, and the application returned to the main screen of the Audio Recorder. The recording named \"Record-1\" is now visible on the main screen below the timer, confirming that the save operation was completed. This action successfully completed Subgoal 3.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,540],\"end_point\":[300,540],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (approximately [900, 540]) to the upper-middle of the screen (approximately [300, 540]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the \\'Audio Recorder\\' app can be searched for. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing a grid of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Audio Recorder\\' app, as the app drawer is where the app is expected to be found.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[342,400],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Audio Recor...\\' app icon (approximate bounding box [291, 295, 393, 506]) at its center [342, 400] to open the Audio Recorder app. This action is expected to launch the app and display its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Audio Recor...\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Audio Recorder\\' app opened and is now displaying its welcome screen. This action completed Subgoal 1, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[895,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Get started\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom of the screen. The button\\'s bounding box is [869, 327, 922, 675]. Tapping this button is expected to take the user to the main screen of the audio recorder, where the recording can be started. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Get started\\' button (located at [895, 501] in the previous screen) was successful. The application navigated from the welcome screen to the \\'Setup\\' screen. This screen presents various configuration options for audio recording and has \\'Reset\\' and \\'Apply\\' buttons at the bottom. This action brought the agent closer to starting a recording by progressing through the app\\'s initial setup.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 13: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[939,748],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Apply\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom right of the screen. The button\\'s bounding box is [912, 509, 966, 987]. Tapping this button is expected to apply the current settings and navigate to the main recording screen.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,759],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom right of the \\'New name\\' dialog. The button\\'s bounding box is [537, 647, 595, 871]. Tapping this button is expected to save the audio recording with the name \\'Record-1\\' and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Save\\' button (located at [566, 759] in the \\'New name\\' dialog) was successful. The \\'New name\\' dialog closed, and the application returned to the main screen of the Audio Recorder. The recording named \"Record-1\" is now visible on the main screen below the timer, confirming that the save operation was completed. This action successfully completed Subgoal 3.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,540],\"end_point\":[300,540],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (approximately [900, 540]) to the upper-middle of the screen (approximately [300, 540]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the \\'Audio Recorder\\' app can be searched for. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing a grid of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Audio Recorder\\' app, as the app drawer is where the app is expected to be found.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[342,400],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Audio Recor...\\' app icon (approximate bounding box [291, 295, 393, 506]) at its center [342, 400] to open the Audio Recorder app. This action is expected to launch the app and display its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Audio Recor...\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Audio Recorder\\' app opened and is now displaying its welcome screen. This action completed Subgoal 1, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[895,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Get started\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom of the screen. The button\\'s bounding box is [869, 327, 922, 675]. Tapping this button is expected to take the user to the main screen of the audio recorder, where the recording can be started. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Get started\\' button (located at [895, 501] in the previous screen) was successful. The application navigated from the welcome screen to the \\'Setup\\' screen. This screen presents various configuration options for audio recording and has \\'Reset\\' and \\'Apply\\' buttons at the bottom. This action brought the agent closer to starting a recording by progressing through the app\\'s initial setup.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[939,748],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Apply\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom right of the screen. The button\\'s bounding box is [912, 509, 966, 987]. Tapping this button is expected to apply the current settings and navigate to the main recording screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Apply\\' button (located at [939, 748] in the previous screen) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Setup\\' screen to the main recording interface of the \\'Audio Recorder\\' app. This screen displays a timer (\\'00:00\\'), recording format details, and a large central button, which is the record button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by reaching the screen where recording can be initiated.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 300, 98, 713], \\'text\\': \\'Audio Recorder\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [392, 323, 462, 681], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \\\\\\'\"Ih\\\\\\'}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [700, 326, 760, 678], \\'text\\': \\'00:00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [805, 347, 825, 653], \\'text\\': \\'0 Mb, MAa, 44.1kHz\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [884, 436, 939, 564]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 819, 37, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 906, 37, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 296, 102, 708]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[566,759],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Save\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom right of the \\'New name\\' dialog. The button\\'s bounding box is [537, 647, 595, 871]. Tapping this button is expected to save the audio recording with the name \\'Record-1\\' and close the dialog. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Save\\' button (located at [566, 759] in the \\'New name\\' dialog) was successful. The \\'New name\\' dialog closed, and the application returned to the main screen of the Audio Recorder. The recording named \"Record-1\" is now visible on the main screen below the timer, confirming that the save operation was completed. This action successfully completed Subgoal 3.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,540],\"end_point\":[300,540],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (approximately [900, 540]) to the upper-middle of the screen (approximately [300, 540]) to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the \\'Audio Recorder\\' app can be searched for. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing a grid of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Audio Recorder\\' app, as the app drawer is where the app is expected to be found.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[342,400],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Audio Recor...\\' app icon (approximate bounding box [291, 295, 393, 506]) at its center [342, 400] to open the Audio Recorder app. This action is expected to launch the app and display its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Audio Recor...\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Audio Recorder\\' app opened and is now displaying its welcome screen. This action completed Subgoal 1, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[895,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Get started\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom of the screen. The button\\'s bounding box is [869, 327, 922, 675]. Tapping this button is expected to take the user to the main screen of the audio recorder, where the recording can be started. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Get started\\' button (located at [895, 501] in the previous screen) was successful. The application navigated from the welcome screen to the \\'Setup\\' screen. This screen presents various configuration options for audio recording and has \\'Reset\\' and \\'Apply\\' buttons at the bottom. This action brought the agent closer to starting a recording by progressing through the app\\'s initial setup.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[939,748],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Apply\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom right of the screen. The button\\'s bounding box is [912, 509, 966, 987]. Tapping this button is expected to apply the current settings and navigate to the main recording screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Apply\\' button (located at [939, 748] in the previous screen) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Setup\\' screen to the main recording interface of the \\'Audio Recorder\\' app. This screen displays a timer (\\'00:00\\'), recording format details, and a large central button, which is the record button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by reaching the screen where recording can be initiated.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 14: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the large white circular record button located in the center of the screen (approximate bounding box [884, 436, 939, 564], center [911, 500]). This action is expected to start the audio recording. The timer should start counting, and the waveform animation might change to indicate recording is in progress.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the large white circular record button located in the center of the screen (approximate bounding box [884, 436, 939, 564], center [911, 500]). This action is expected to start the audio recording. The timer should start counting, and the waveform animation might change to indicate recording is in progress. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the record button (located at [911, 500] in the previous screen) was successful. The audio recording started. The UI changed significantly: the timer started counting and now shows \"00:03\", the text \"Recording...\" appeared, the central record button (circle) transformed into a pause button (two vertical lines), and a delete button (trash can icon) appeared to the left of the pause button. This action successfully progressed Subgoal 2 towards completion.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 300, 98, 712], \\'text\\': \\'Audio Recorder\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [284, 231, 300, 441], \\'text\\': \\'00.00 00.02\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [283, 494, 300, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'0.04 00.06 00.08 00:.10 00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [480, 231, 497, 441], \\'text\\': \\'00.00 00.02\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [477, 490, 500, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'0.04 00.06 00.08 00.10 00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [703, 329, 758, 675], \\'text\\': \\'00:03\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [771, 325, 824, 675], \\'text\\': \\'Recording_ 0.04 Mb, M4a, 44.1kHz\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [880, 445, 931, 620], \\'text\\': \\'11 )\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [883, 433, 939, 565]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [884, 637, 939, 740]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [885, 259, 941, 367]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [473, 472, 505, 560]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 819, 39, 897]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 142, 37, 188]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to start the audio recording. The timer should start counting, and the waveform animation might change to indicate recording is in progress. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the record button (located at [911, 500] in the previous screen) was successful. The audio recording started. The UI changed significantly: the timer started counting and now shows \"00:03\", the text \"Recording...\" appeared, the central record button (circle) transformed into a pause button (two vertical lines), and a delete button (trash can icon) appeared to the left of the pause button.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[342,400],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Audio Recor...\\' app icon (approximate bounding box [291, 295, 393, 506]) at its center [342, 400] to open the Audio Recorder app. This action is expected to launch the app and display its main interface. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Audio Recor...\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Audio Recorder\\' app opened and is now displaying its welcome screen. This action completed Subgoal 1, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[895,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Get started\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom of the screen. The button\\'s bounding box is [869, 327, 922, 675]. Tapping this button is expected to take the user to the main screen of the audio recorder, where the recording can be started. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Get started\\' button (located at [895, 501] in the previous screen) was successful. The application navigated from the welcome screen to the \\'Setup\\' screen. This screen presents various configuration options for audio recording and has \\'Reset\\' and \\'Apply\\' buttons at the bottom. This action brought the agent closer to starting a recording by progressing through the app\\'s initial setup.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[939,748],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Apply\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom right of the screen. The button\\'s bounding box is [912, 509, 966, 987]. Tapping this button is expected to apply the current settings and navigate to the main recording screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Apply\\' button (located at [939, 748] in the previous screen) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Setup\\' screen to the main recording interface of the \\'Audio Recorder\\' app. This screen displays a timer (\\'00:00\\'), recording format details, and a large central button, which is the record button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by reaching the screen where recording can be initiated.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the large white circular record button located in the center of the screen (approximate bounding box [884, 436, 939, 564], center [911, 500]). This action is expected to start the audio recording. The timer should start counting, and the waveform animation might change to indicate recording is in progress. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the record button (located at [911, 500] in the previous screen) was successful. The audio recording started. The UI changed significantly: the timer started counting and now shows \"00:03\", the text \"Recording...\" appeared, the central record button (circle) transformed into a pause button (two vertical lines), and a delete button (trash can icon) appeared to the left of the pause button. This action successfully progressed Subgoal 2 towards completion.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Makes the agent wait for 10 seconds. Use this if a page is not loaded.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Wait for 10 seconds to allow the audio recording to continue for a sufficient duration. The recording is currently at 3 seconds. This action will fulfill the \\'wait for 5 seconds\\' step in the plan. Actual Outcome: The `WAIT` action was successful. The audio recording continued for an additional 61 seconds, with the timer advancing from \"00:03\" to \"01:04\". This fulfilled the requirement of waiting for the recording to progress. Subgoal 2 (\"Start Audio Recording\") is now complete. The agent is closer to the overall user instruction, as the recording has been made and the next step is to stop it.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 16: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[895,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Get started\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom of the screen. The button\\'s bounding box is [869, 327, 922, 675]. Tapping this button is expected to take the user to the main screen of the audio recorder, where the recording can be started. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Get started\\' button (located at [895, 501] in the previous screen) was successful. The application navigated from the welcome screen to the \\'Setup\\' screen. This screen presents various configuration options for audio recording and has \\'Reset\\' and \\'Apply\\' buttons at the bottom. This action brought the agent closer to starting a recording by progressing through the app\\'s initial setup.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[939,748],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Apply\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom right of the screen. The button\\'s bounding box is [912, 509, 966, 987]. Tapping this button is expected to apply the current settings and navigate to the main recording screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Apply\\' button (located at [939, 748] in the previous screen) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Setup\\' screen to the main recording interface of the \\'Audio Recorder\\' app. This screen displays a timer (\\'00:00\\'), recording format details, and a large central button, which is the record button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by reaching the screen where recording can be initiated.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the large white circular record button located in the center of the screen (approximate bounding box [884, 436, 939, 564], center [911, 500]). This action is expected to start the audio recording. The timer should start counting, and the waveform animation might change to indicate recording is in progress. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the record button (located at [911, 500] in the previous screen) was successful. The audio recording started. The UI changed significantly: the timer started counting and now shows \"00:03\", the text \"Recording...\" appeared, the central record button (circle) transformed into a pause button (two vertical lines), and a delete button (trash can icon) appeared to the left of the pause button. This action successfully progressed Subgoal 2 towards completion.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Makes the agent wait for 10 seconds. Use this if a page is not loaded.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Wait for 10 seconds to allow the audio recording to continue for a sufficient duration. The recording is currently at 3 seconds. This action will fulfill the \\'wait for 5 seconds\\' step in the plan. Actual Outcome: The `WAIT` action was successful. The audio recording continued for an additional 61 seconds, with the timer advancing from \"00:03\" to \"01:04\". This fulfilled the requirement of waiting for the recording to progress. Subgoal 2 (\"Start Audio Recording\") is now complete. The agent is closer to the overall user instruction, as the recording has been made and the next step is to stop it.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,499],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the pause button (two vertical bars) located in the center of the screen (approximate bounding box [883, 432, 939, 566], center [911, 499]) to stop the audio recording. This action is expected to stop the recording and potentially present options to save or discard the recording. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the pause button (previously at the center, [911, 499]) was successful. The audio recording transitioned from \"Recording...\" to \"Paused\". The timer shows \"01:52\". The central button now displays \"REC\". To the right of the \"REC\" button, a checkmark/done icon has appeared, and to its left, a delete icon is present. This action has moved the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by pausing the recording. The next step is to finalize this paused recording by tapping the checkmark/done button.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 300, 98, 712], \\'text\\': \\'Audio Recorder\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [283, 0, 300, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'.44 01.46 01.48 01.50 01.62 01.54 01.56 01.58 02.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [479, 0, 498, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'44 01.46 01.48 01.50 01.62 01.54 01.56 01.58 02.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [702, 329, 757, 676], \\'text\\': \\'01.52\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [771, 406, 798, 595], \\'text\\': \\'Paused\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [805, 325, 825, 676], \\'text\\': \\'1.29 Mb, MAa, 44.1kHz\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [901, 457, 925, 558], \\'text\\': \\'Rec\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [885, 432, 941, 574]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 250, 38, 294]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [886, 642, 941, 738]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 192, 37, 243]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 143, 37, 186]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 817, 37, 899]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [887, 262, 940, 364]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 906, 37, 943]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[895,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Get started\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom of the screen. The button\\'s bounding box is [869, 327, 922, 675]. Tapping this button is expected to take the user to the main screen of the audio recorder, where the recording can be started. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Get started\\' button (located at [895, 501] in the previous screen) was successful. The application navigated from the welcome screen to the \\'Setup\\' screen. This screen presents various configuration options for audio recording and has \\'Reset\\' and \\'Apply\\' buttons at the bottom. This action brought the agent closer to starting a recording by progressing through the app\\'s initial setup.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[939,748],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Apply\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom right of the screen. The button\\'s bounding box is [912, 509, 966, 987]. Tapping this button is expected to apply the current settings and navigate to the main recording screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Apply\\' button (located at [939, 748] in the previous screen) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Setup\\' screen to the main recording interface of the \\'Audio Recorder\\' app. This screen displays a timer (\\'00:00\\'), recording format details, and a large central button, which is the record button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by reaching the screen where recording can be initiated.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the large white circular record button located in the center of the screen (approximate bounding box [884, 436, 939, 564], center [911, 500]). This action is expected to start the audio recording. The timer should start counting, and the waveform animation might change to indicate recording is in progress. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the record button (located at [911, 500] in the previous screen) was successful. The audio recording started. The UI changed significantly: the timer started counting and now shows \"00:03\", the text \"Recording...\" appeared, the central record button (circle) transformed into a pause button (two vertical lines), and a delete button (trash can icon) appeared to the left of the pause button. This action successfully progressed Subgoal 2 towards completion.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Makes the agent wait for 10 seconds. Use this if a page is not loaded.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Wait for 10 seconds to allow the audio recording to continue for a sufficient duration. The recording is currently at 3 seconds. This action will fulfill the \\'wait for 5 seconds\\' step in the plan. Actual Outcome: The `WAIT` action was successful. The audio recording continued for an additional 61 seconds, with the timer advancing from \"00:03\" to \"01:04\". This fulfilled the requirement of waiting for the recording to progress. Subgoal 2 (\"Start Audio Recording\") is now complete. The agent is closer to the overall user instruction, as the recording has been made and the next step is to stop it.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,499],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the pause button (two vertical bars) located in the center of the screen (approximate bounding box [883, 432, 939, 566], center [911, 499]) to stop the audio recording. This action is expected to stop the recording and potentially present options to save or discard the recording. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the pause button (previously at the center, [911, 499]) was successful. The audio recording transitioned from \"Recording...\" to \"Paused\". The timer shows \"01:52\". The central button now displays \"REC\". To the right of the \"REC\" button, a checkmark/done icon has appeared, and to its left, a delete icon is present. This action has moved the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by pausing the recording. The next step is to finalize this paused recording by tapping the checkmark/done button.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 17: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[913,690],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark/done button, located to the right of the \\'REC\\' button (approximate bounding box [886, 642, 941, 738], center [913, 690]). This action is expected to finalize the paused recording and proceed to a screen where the recording can be saved or named.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[939,748],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Apply\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom right of the screen. The button\\'s bounding box is [912, 509, 966, 987]. Tapping this button is expected to apply the current settings and navigate to the main recording screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Apply\\' button (located at [939, 748] in the previous screen) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Setup\\' screen to the main recording interface of the \\'Audio Recorder\\' app. This screen displays a timer (\\'00:00\\'), recording format details, and a large central button, which is the record button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by reaching the screen where recording can be initiated.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the large white circular record button located in the center of the screen (approximate bounding box [884, 436, 939, 564], center [911, 500]). This action is expected to start the audio recording. The timer should start counting, and the waveform animation might change to indicate recording is in progress. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the record button (located at [911, 500] in the previous screen) was successful. The audio recording started. The UI changed significantly: the timer started counting and now shows \"00:03\", the text \"Recording...\" appeared, the central record button (circle) transformed into a pause button (two vertical lines), and a delete button (trash can icon) appeared to the left of the pause button. This action successfully progressed Subgoal 2 towards completion.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Makes the agent wait for 10 seconds. Use this if a page is not loaded.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Wait for 10 seconds to allow the audio recording to continue for a sufficient duration. The recording is currently at 3 seconds. This action will fulfill the \\'wait for 5 seconds\\' step in the plan. Actual Outcome: The `WAIT` action was successful. The audio recording continued for an additional 61 seconds, with the timer advancing from \"00:03\" to \"01:04\". This fulfilled the requirement of waiting for the recording to progress. Subgoal 2 (\"Start Audio Recording\") is now complete. The agent is closer to the overall user instruction, as the recording has been made and the next step is to stop it.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,499],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the pause button (two vertical bars) located in the center of the screen (approximate bounding box [883, 432, 939, 566], center [911, 499]) to stop the audio recording. This action is expected to stop the recording and potentially present options to save or discard the recording. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the pause button (previously at the center, [911, 499]) was successful. The audio recording transitioned from \"Recording...\" to \"Paused\". The timer shows \"01:52\". The central button now displays \"REC\". To the right of the \"REC\" button, a checkmark/done icon has appeared, and to its left, a delete icon is present. This action has moved the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by pausing the recording. The next step is to finalize this paused recording by tapping the checkmark/done button.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[913,690],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark/done button, located to the right of the \\'REC\\' button (approximate bounding box [886, 642, 941, 738], center [913, 690]). This action is expected to finalize the paused recording and proceed to a screen where the recording can be saved or named. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the checkmark/done button (previously located around [913, 690]) was successful. A \\'New name\\' dialog appeared, prompting for a filename. The dialog contains a text field pre-filled with \\'Record-1\\', which is currently focused, a \\'Don\\'t ask again\\' checkbox, a \\'Cancel\\' button, and a \\'Save\\' button. This action successfully completed Subgoal 3 by finalizing the recording and presenting the save options, moving the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 41, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 300, 98, 713], \\'text\\': \\'Audio Recorder\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [285, 501, 299, 545], \\'text\\': \\'00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [284, 588, 299, 678], \\'text\\': \\'00.10\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [283, 722, 300, 813], \\'text\\': \\'00.20\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [283, 855, 300, 947], \\'text\\': \\'00.30\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [387, 113, 411, 375], \\'text\\': \\'New name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [446, 121, 465, 296], \\'text\\': \\'Record-1\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [498, 207, 518, 444], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \"Don\\\\\\'t ask again\"}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [556, 448, 572, 565], \\'text\\': \\'Cancel\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [557, 718, 572, 804], \\'text\\': \\'Save\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [701, 328, 759, 676], \\'text\\': \\'00.00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [773, 372, 797, 587], \\'text\\': \\'Record-1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [808, 35, 825, 141], \\'text\\': \\'00.00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [806, 325, 824, 675], \\'text\\': \\'1.31 Mb, MAa, 44.1kHz\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [808, 859, 825, 963], \\'text\\': \\'01.52\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [537, 647, 595, 871]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [537, 394, 596, 629]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [423, 110, 476, 883]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 819, 37, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [883, 436, 947, 565]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 197, 37, 238]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 906, 37, 942]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"1\", text=\"Record-1\", resource-id=\"com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.dimowner.audiorecorder\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[123,1034][957,1152]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Record-1\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[939,748],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Apply\\' button, which is a yellow button located at the bottom right of the screen. The button\\'s bounding box is [912, 509, 966, 987]. Tapping this button is expected to apply the current settings and navigate to the main recording screen. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Apply\\' button (located at [939, 748] in the previous screen) was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Setup\\' screen to the main recording interface of the \\'Audio Recorder\\' app. This screen displays a timer (\\'00:00\\'), recording format details, and a large central button, which is the record button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by reaching the screen where recording can be initiated.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the large white circular record button located in the center of the screen (approximate bounding box [884, 436, 939, 564], center [911, 500]). This action is expected to start the audio recording. The timer should start counting, and the waveform animation might change to indicate recording is in progress. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the record button (located at [911, 500] in the previous screen) was successful. The audio recording started. The UI changed significantly: the timer started counting and now shows \"00:03\", the text \"Recording...\" appeared, the central record button (circle) transformed into a pause button (two vertical lines), and a delete button (trash can icon) appeared to the left of the pause button. This action successfully progressed Subgoal 2 towards completion.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Makes the agent wait for 10 seconds. Use this if a page is not loaded.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Wait for 10 seconds to allow the audio recording to continue for a sufficient duration. The recording is currently at 3 seconds. This action will fulfill the \\'wait for 5 seconds\\' step in the plan. Actual Outcome: The `WAIT` action was successful. The audio recording continued for an additional 61 seconds, with the timer advancing from \"00:03\" to \"01:04\". This fulfilled the requirement of waiting for the recording to progress. Subgoal 2 (\"Start Audio Recording\") is now complete. The agent is closer to the overall user instruction, as the recording has been made and the next step is to stop it.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,499],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the pause button (two vertical bars) located in the center of the screen (approximate bounding box [883, 432, 939, 566], center [911, 499]) to stop the audio recording. This action is expected to stop the recording and potentially present options to save or discard the recording. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the pause button (previously at the center, [911, 499]) was successful. The audio recording transitioned from \"Recording...\" to \"Paused\". The timer shows \"01:52\". The central button now displays \"REC\". To the right of the \"REC\" button, a checkmark/done icon has appeared, and to its left, a delete icon is present. This action has moved the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by pausing the recording. The next step is to finalize this paused recording by tapping the checkmark/done button.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[913,690],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark/done button, located to the right of the \\'REC\\' button (approximate bounding box [886, 642, 941, 738], center [913, 690]). This action is expected to finalize the paused recording and proceed to a screen where the recording can be saved or named. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the checkmark/done button (previously located around [913, 690]) was successful. A \\'New name\\' dialog appeared, prompting for a filename. The dialog contains a text field pre-filled with \\'Record-1\\', which is currently focused, a \\'Don\\'t ask again\\' checkbox, a \\'Cancel\\' button, and a \\'Save\\' button. This action successfully completed Subgoal 3 by finalizing the recording and presenting the save options, moving the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 18: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'Record-1\\' from the focused text field. The text field is identified by resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\' and has bounds=\\'[423,123,476,957]\\'.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the large white circular record button located in the center of the screen (approximate bounding box [884, 436, 939, 564], center [911, 500]). This action is expected to start the audio recording. The timer should start counting, and the waveform animation might change to indicate recording is in progress. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the record button (located at [911, 500] in the previous screen) was successful. The audio recording started. The UI changed significantly: the timer started counting and now shows \"00:03\", the text \"Recording...\" appeared, the central record button (circle) transformed into a pause button (two vertical lines), and a delete button (trash can icon) appeared to the left of the pause button. This action successfully progressed Subgoal 2 towards completion.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Makes the agent wait for 10 seconds. Use this if a page is not loaded.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Wait for 10 seconds to allow the audio recording to continue for a sufficient duration. The recording is currently at 3 seconds. This action will fulfill the \\'wait for 5 seconds\\' step in the plan. Actual Outcome: The `WAIT` action was successful. The audio recording continued for an additional 61 seconds, with the timer advancing from \"00:03\" to \"01:04\". This fulfilled the requirement of waiting for the recording to progress. Subgoal 2 (\"Start Audio Recording\") is now complete. The agent is closer to the overall user instruction, as the recording has been made and the next step is to stop it.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,499],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the pause button (two vertical bars) located in the center of the screen (approximate bounding box [883, 432, 939, 566], center [911, 499]) to stop the audio recording. This action is expected to stop the recording and potentially present options to save or discard the recording. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the pause button (previously at the center, [911, 499]) was successful. The audio recording transitioned from \"Recording...\" to \"Paused\". The timer shows \"01:52\". The central button now displays \"REC\". To the right of the \"REC\" button, a checkmark/done icon has appeared, and to its left, a delete icon is present. This action has moved the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by pausing the recording. The next step is to finalize this paused recording by tapping the checkmark/done button.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[913,690],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark/done button, located to the right of the \\'REC\\' button (approximate bounding box [886, 642, 941, 738], center [913, 690]). This action is expected to finalize the paused recording and proceed to a screen where the recording can be saved or named. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the checkmark/done button (previously located around [913, 690]) was successful. A \\'New name\\' dialog appeared, prompting for a filename. The dialog contains a text field pre-filled with \\'Record-1\\', which is currently focused, a \\'Don\\'t ask again\\' checkbox, a \\'Cancel\\' button, and a \\'Save\\' button. This action successfully completed Subgoal 3 by finalizing the recording and presenting the save options, moving the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'Record-1\\' from the focused text field. The text field is identified by resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\' and has bounds=\\'[423,123,476,957]\\'. After this action, the text field should be empty, ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action successfully cleared the text \\'Record-1\\' from the focused text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\'). The text field is now empty, as confirmed by both the visual screenshot and the updated XML data (text=\"\"). This action was successful and prepares the text field for the new filename input, moving the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nRecord an audio clip and save it with name \"presentation_fGwr.m4a\" using Audio Recorder app.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the large white circular record button located in the center of the screen (approximate bounding box [884, 436, 939, 564], center [911, 500]). This action is expected to start the audio recording. The timer should start counting, and the waveform animation might change to indicate recording is in progress. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the record button (located at [911, 500] in the previous screen) was successful. The audio recording started. The UI changed significantly: the timer started counting and now shows \"00:03\", the text \"Recording...\" appeared, the central record button (circle) transformed into a pause button (two vertical lines), and a delete button (trash can icon) appeared to the left of the pause button. This action successfully progressed Subgoal 2 towards completion.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Makes the agent wait for 10 seconds. Use this if a page is not loaded.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Wait for 10 seconds to allow the audio recording to continue for a sufficient duration. The recording is currently at 3 seconds. This action will fulfill the \\'wait for 5 seconds\\' step in the plan. Actual Outcome: The `WAIT` action was successful. The audio recording continued for an additional 61 seconds, with the timer advancing from \"00:03\" to \"01:04\". This fulfilled the requirement of waiting for the recording to progress. Subgoal 2 (\"Start Audio Recording\") is now complete. The agent is closer to the overall user instruction, as the recording has been made and the next step is to stop it.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,499],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the pause button (two vertical bars) located in the center of the screen (approximate bounding box [883, 432, 939, 566], center [911, 499]) to stop the audio recording. This action is expected to stop the recording and potentially present options to save or discard the recording. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the pause button (previously at the center, [911, 499]) was successful. The audio recording transitioned from \"Recording...\" to \"Paused\". The timer shows \"01:52\". The central button now displays \"REC\". To the right of the \"REC\" button, a checkmark/done icon has appeared, and to its left, a delete icon is present. This action has moved the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by pausing the recording. The next step is to finalize this paused recording by tapping the checkmark/done button.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[913,690],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark/done button, located to the right of the \\'REC\\' button (approximate bounding box [886, 642, 941, 738], center [913, 690]). This action is expected to finalize the paused recording and proceed to a screen where the recording can be saved or named. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the checkmark/done button (previously located around [913, 690]) was successful. A \\'New name\\' dialog appeared, prompting for a filename. The dialog contains a text field pre-filled with \\'Record-1\\', which is currently focused, a \\'Don\\'t ask again\\' checkbox, a \\'Cancel\\' button, and a \\'Save\\' button. This action successfully completed Subgoal 3 by finalizing the recording and presenting the save options, moving the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'Record-1\\' from the focused text field. The text field is identified by resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\' and has bounds=\\'[423,123,476,957]\\'. After this action, the text field should be empty, ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action successfully cleared the text \\'Record-1\\' from the focused text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\'). The text field is now empty, as confirmed by both the visual screenshot and the updated XML data (text=\"\").

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use this if a page is not loaded.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Wait for 10 seconds to allow the audio recording to continue for a sufficient duration. The recording is currently at 3 seconds. This action will fulfill the \\'wait for 5 seconds\\' step in the plan. Actual Outcome: The `WAIT` action was successful. The audio recording continued for an additional 61 seconds, with the timer advancing from \"00:03\" to \"01:04\". This fulfilled the requirement of waiting for the recording to progress. Subgoal 2 (\"Start Audio Recording\") is now complete. The agent is closer to the overall user instruction, as the recording has been made and the next step is to stop it.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,499],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the pause button (two vertical bars) located in the center of the screen (approximate bounding box [883, 432, 939, 566], center [911, 499]) to stop the audio recording. This action is expected to stop the recording and potentially present options to save or discard the recording. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the pause button (previously at the center, [911, 499]) was successful. The audio recording transitioned from \"Recording...\" to \"Paused\". The timer shows \"01:52\". The central button now displays \"REC\". To the right of the \"REC\" button, a checkmark/done icon has appeared, and to its left, a delete icon is present. This action has moved the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by pausing the recording. The next step is to finalize this paused recording by tapping the checkmark/done button.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[913,690],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark/done button, located to the right of the \\'REC\\' button (approximate bounding box [886, 642, 941, 738], center [913, 690]). This action is expected to finalize the paused recording and proceed to a screen where the recording can be saved or named. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the checkmark/done button (previously located around [913, 690]) was successful. A \\'New name\\' dialog appeared, prompting for a filename. The dialog contains a text field pre-filled with \\'Record-1\\', which is currently focused, a \\'Don\\'t ask again\\' checkbox, a \\'Cancel\\' button, and a \\'Save\\' button. This action successfully completed Subgoal 3 by finalizing the recording and presenting the save options, moving the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'Record-1\\' from the focused text field. The text field is identified by resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\' and has bounds=\\'[423,123,476,957]\\'. After this action, the text field should be empty, ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action successfully cleared the text \\'Record-1\\' from the focused text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\'). The text field is now empty, as confirmed by both the visual screenshot and the updated XML data (text=\"\"). This action was successful and prepares the text field for the new filename input, moving the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"presentation_fGwr.m4a\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\' into the currently focused and empty text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\', bounds=\\'[123,1034][957,1152]\\'). This will set the filename for the audio recording. After this action, the text field should contain \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\'. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\' into the focused text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\'). The screenshot after the action shows the text field populated with \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\', and the XML data confirms this (text=\"presentation_fGwr.m4a\"). This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use this if a page is not loaded.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Wait for 10 seconds to allow the audio recording to continue for a sufficient duration. The recording is currently at 3 seconds. This action will fulfill the \\'wait for 5 seconds\\' step in the plan. Actual Outcome: The `WAIT` action was successful. The audio recording continued for an additional 61 seconds, with the timer advancing from \"00:03\" to \"01:04\". This fulfilled the requirement of waiting for the recording to progress. Subgoal 2 (\"Start Audio Recording\") is now complete. The agent is closer to the overall user instruction, as the recording has been made and the next step is to stop it.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[911,499],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the pause button (two vertical bars) located in the center of the screen (approximate bounding box [883, 432, 939, 566], center [911, 499]) to stop the audio recording. This action is expected to stop the recording and potentially present options to save or discard the recording. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the pause button (previously at the center, [911, 499]) was successful. The audio recording transitioned from \"Recording...\" to \"Paused\". The timer shows \"01:52\". The central button now displays \"REC\". To the right of the \"REC\" button, a checkmark/done icon has appeared, and to its left, a delete icon is present. This action has moved the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by pausing the recording. The next step is to finalize this paused recording by tapping the checkmark/done button.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[913,690],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark/done button, located to the right of the \\'REC\\' button (approximate bounding box [886, 642, 941, 738], center [913, 690]). This action is expected to finalize the paused recording and proceed to a screen where the recording can be saved or named. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the checkmark/done button (previously located around [913, 690]) was successful. A \\'New name\\' dialog appeared, prompting for a filename. The dialog contains a text field pre-filled with \\'Record-1\\', which is currently focused, a \\'Don\\'t ask again\\' checkbox, a \\'Cancel\\' button, and a \\'Save\\' button. This action successfully completed Subgoal 3 by finalizing the recording and presenting the save options, moving the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'Record-1\\' from the focused text field. The text field is identified by resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\' and has bounds=\\'[423,123,476,957]\\'. After this action, the text field should be empty, ready for the new filename input. Actual Outcome: The `DELETE_TEXT` action successfully cleared the text \\'Record-1\\' from the focused text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\'). The text field is now empty, as confirmed by both the visual screenshot and the updated XML data (text=\"\"). This action was successful and prepares the text field for the new filename input, moving the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"presentation_fGwr.m4a\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\' into the currently focused and empty text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\', bounds=\\'[123,1034][957,1152]\\'). This will set the filename for the audio recording. After this action, the text field should contain \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\'. Actual Outcome: The `INPUT_TEXT` action successfully entered \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\' into the focused text field (resource-id=\\'com.dimowner.audiorecorder:id/input_name\\'). The screenshot after the action shows the text field populated with \\'presentation_fGwr.m4a\\', and the XML data confirms this (text=\"presentation_fGwr.m4a\"). This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 20: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
