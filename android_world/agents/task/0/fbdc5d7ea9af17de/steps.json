Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible.

Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal.

If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to open the Clock app. The \\'Clock\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clock\\' app icon at [606, 165] successfully opened the Clock application. The screen now shows the main interface of the Clock app, displaying the current time and navigation tabs at the bottom (\\'Alarm\\', \\'Clock\\', \\'Timer\\', \\'Stopwatch\\', \\'Bedtime\\'). This action has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user instruction by completing the first subgoal. The next step is to tap the \\'Timer\\' tab to navigate to the timer section.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.35\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'IXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 567, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'IYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 55, 100, 208], \\'text\\': \\'Clock\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [78, 385, 95, 854], \\'text\\': \\'You can find the privacy policy here\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [164, 52, 272, 562], \\'text\\': \\'15.35 Sun, Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 51, 959, 150], \\'text\\': \\'Alarm\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [942, 250, 959, 350], \\'text\\': \\'Clock\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 450, 959, 549], \\'text\\': \\'Timer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [942, 607, 962, 971], \\'text\\': \\'Stopwatch Bedtime\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [764, 381, 869, 621]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 199, 968, 397]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 587, 967, 807]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [895, 418, 967, 576]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 808, 967, 989]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [895, 5, 972, 198]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 350, 113, 900]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 915, 110, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 821, 38, 896]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 38, 240]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Do not start the timer.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 2 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (y=900) to the middle of the screen (y=300) to open the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, including the Clock app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a grid of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Clock\\' app is now visible and accessible. The next step is to tap the \\'Clock\\' app icon.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[606,165],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clock\\' app icon located in the app drawer at approximately [606, 165]. This action is intended to open the Clock app. The \\'Clock\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clock\\' app icon at [606, 165] successfully opened the Clock application. The screen now shows the main interface of the Clock app, displaying the current time and navigation tabs at the bottom (\\'Alarm\\', \\'Clock\\', \\'Timer\\', \\'Stopwatch\\', \\'Bedtime\\'). This action has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user instruction by completing the first subgoal. The next step is to tap the \\'Timer\\' tab to navigate to the timer section.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 2: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Do not start the timer.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 3 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (y=900) to the middle of the screen (y=300) to open the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, including the Clock app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a grid of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Clock\\' app is now visible and accessible. The next step is to tap the \\'Clock\\' app icon.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[606,165],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clock\\' app icon located in the app drawer at approximately [606, 165]. This action is intended to open the Clock app. The \\'Clock\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clock\\' app icon at [606, 165] successfully opened the Clock application. The screen now shows the main interface of the Clock app, displaying the current time and navigation tabs at the bottom (\\'Alarm\\', \\'Clock\\', \\'Timer\\', \\'Stopwatch\\', \\'Bedtime\\'). This action has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user instruction by completing the first subgoal. The next step is to tap the \\'Timer\\' tab to navigate to the timer section.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[951,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Timer\\' tab, which is located at the bottom of the screen at approximately [951, 500]. This action is intended to switch from the current \\'Clock\\' view to the \\'Timer\\' view within the Clock app. The \\'Timer\\' tab is currently not selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Timer\\' tab at [951, 500] was successful. The Clock app navigated to the Timer section, which now displays a numpad for setting the timer duration. This action completed the active subgoal. The next step is to input the timer duration.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This is the first digit of the \\'1635\\' sequence needed to set the timer to 00 hours, 16 minutes, and 35 seconds. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 01s\\'.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17.

Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

This action is intended to open the Clock app. The \\'Clock\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clock\\' app icon at [606, 165] successfully opened the Clock application. The screen now shows the main interface of the Clock app, displaying the current time and navigation tabs at the bottom (\\'Alarm\\', \\'Clock\\', \\'Timer\\', \\'Stopwatch\\', \\'Bedtime\\'). This action has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user instruction by completing the first subgoal.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[951,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Timer\\' tab, which is located at the bottom of the screen at approximately [951, 500]. This action is intended to switch from the current \\'Clock\\' view to the \\'Timer\\' view within the Clock app. The \\'Timer\\' tab is currently not selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Timer\\' tab at [951, 500] was successful. The Clock app navigated to the Timer section, which now displays a numpad for setting the timer duration. This action completed the active subgoal. The next step is to input the timer duration.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'1\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [338, 250]. This is the first digit of the \\'1635\\' sequence needed to set the timer to 00 hours, 16 minutes, and 35 seconds. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'1\\' on the numpad at [338, 250] changed the timer display from \"00h 00m 00s\" to \"00h 00m 01s\". A play button also appeared, indicating the timer is ready to be started. While this action did input a digit, it was not the correct first digit according to the right-to-left input method (seconds, minutes, hours). The intended time is 00h 16m 35s. The input \\'1\\' was interpreted as 1 second. To correct this and proceed, the \\'1\\' needs to be cleared using the backspace button before entering the correct sequence (3, 5, 1, 6, 0, 0).\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 55, 100, 204], \\'text\\': \\'Timer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 155, 228, 858], \\'text\\': \\'OOn OOm Ols\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 474, 357, 528], \\'text\\': \\'2\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 727, 357, 782], \\'text\\': \\'3\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [438, 474, 472, 528], \\'text\\': \\'5\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [553, 472, 586, 530], \\'text\\': \\'8\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [667, 185, 704, 310], \\'text\\': \\'00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [667, 457, 704, 536], \\'text\\': \\'0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 51, 959, 150], \\'text\\': \\'Alarm\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 250, 959, 349], \\'text\\': \\'Clock\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [941, 448, 960, 551], \\'text\\': \\'Timer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [942, 607, 962, 971], \\'text\\': \\'Stopwatch Bedtime\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [764, 382, 870, 621]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [631, 632, 742, 882]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 584, 967, 807]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 400, 967, 590]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [894, 198, 973, 393]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [892, 4, 981, 199]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 808, 966, 978]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

Do not start the timer.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 4 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (y=900) to the middle of the screen (y=300) to open the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, including the Clock app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a grid of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Clock\\' app is now visible and accessible. The next step is to tap the \\'Clock\\' app icon.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[606,165],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clock\\' app icon located in the app drawer at approximately [606, 165]. This action is intended to open the Clock app. The \\'Clock\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clock\\' app icon at [606, 165] successfully opened the Clock application. The screen now shows the main interface of the Clock app, displaying the current time and navigation tabs at the bottom (\\'Alarm\\', \\'Clock\\', \\'Timer\\', \\'Stopwatch\\', \\'Bedtime\\'). This action has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user instruction by completing the first subgoal. The next step is to tap the \\'Timer\\' tab to navigate to the timer section.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[951,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Timer\\' tab, which is located at the bottom of the screen at approximately [951, 500]. This action is intended to switch from the current \\'Clock\\' view to the \\'Timer\\' view within the Clock app. The \\'Timer\\' tab is currently not selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Timer\\' tab at [951, 500] was successful. The Clock app navigated to the Timer section, which now displays a numpad for setting the timer duration. This action completed the active subgoal. The next step is to input the timer duration.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'1\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [338, 250]. This is the first digit of the \\'1635\\' sequence needed to set the timer to 00 hours, 16 minutes, and 35 seconds. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'1\\' on the numpad at [338, 250] changed the timer display from \"00h 00m 00s\" to \"00h 00m 01s\". A play button also appeared, indicating the timer is ready to be started. While this action did input a digit, it was not the correct first digit according to the right-to-left input method (seconds, minutes, hours). The intended time is 00h 16m 35s. The input \\'1\\' was interpreted as 1 second. To correct this and proceed, the \\'1\\' needs to be cleared using the backspace button before entering the correct sequence (3, 5, 1, 6, 0, 0).\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button (icon with a left arrow and cross) located at approximately [686, 757] on the numpad. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. This action is intended to clear the \\'01s\\' input, resetting the timer display to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Clock App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Clock app is open and visible on the screen.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, including the Clock app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a grid of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Clock\\' app is now visible and accessible. The next step is to tap the \\'Clock\\' app icon.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[606,165],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clock\\' app icon located in the app drawer at approximately [606, 165]. This action is intended to open the Clock app. The \\'Clock\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clock\\' app icon at [606, 165] successfully opened the Clock application. The screen now shows the main interface of the Clock app, displaying the current time and navigation tabs at the bottom (\\'Alarm\\', \\'Clock\\', \\'Timer\\', \\'Stopwatch\\', \\'Bedtime\\'). This action has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user instruction by completing the first subgoal. The next step is to tap the \\'Timer\\' tab to navigate to the timer section.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[951,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Timer\\' tab, which is located at the bottom of the screen at approximately [951, 500]. This action is intended to switch from the current \\'Clock\\' view to the \\'Timer\\' view within the Clock app. The \\'Timer\\' tab is currently not selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Timer\\' tab at [951, 500] was successful. The Clock app navigated to the Timer section, which now displays a numpad for setting the timer duration. This action completed the active subgoal. The next step is to input the timer duration.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'1\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [338, 250]. This is the first digit of the \\'1635\\' sequence needed to set the timer to 00 hours, 16 minutes, and 35 seconds. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'1\\' on the numpad at [338, 250] changed the timer display from \"00h 00m 00s\" to \"00h 00m 01s\". A play button also appeared, indicating the timer is ready to be started. While this action did input a digit, it was not the correct first digit according to the right-to-left input method (seconds, minutes, hours). The intended time is 00h 16m 35s. The input \\'1\\' was interpreted as 1 second. To correct this and proceed, the \\'1\\' needs to be cleared using the backspace button before entering the correct sequence (3, 5, 1, 6, 0, 0).\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button (icon with a left arrow and cross) located at approximately [686, 757] on the numpad. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. This action is intended to clear the \\'01s\\' input, resetting the timer display to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button (icon with a left arrow and cross) at approximately [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 01s\\' to \\'00h 00m 00s\\', effectively clearing the previous incorrect input. This action corrected the state and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The device is now ready for the correct sequence of digits to be entered for the timer.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 43, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.42\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 55, 100, 204], \\'text\\': \\'Timer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [174, 154, 229, 862], \\'text\\': \\'OOn OOm OOs\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 474, 357, 528], \\'text\\': \\'2\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 727, 357, 782], \\'text\\': \\'3\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [438, 474, 472, 528], \\'text\\': \\'5\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [553, 472, 586, 530], \\'text\\': \\'8\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [667, 185, 704, 310], \\'text\\': \\'00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [667, 457, 704, 536], \\'text\\': \\'0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 51, 959, 150], \\'text\\': \\'Alarm\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 250, 959, 349], \\'text\\': \\'Clock\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [941, 448, 960, 551], \\'text\\': \\'Timer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [942, 607, 962, 971], \\'text\\': \\'Stopwatch Bedtime\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [630, 631, 742, 881]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 399, 969, 589]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [894, 202, 978, 388]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 590, 972, 805]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [893, 5, 983, 197]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [897, 812, 973, 975]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [631, 378, 742, 623]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [631, 123, 742, 370]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 821, 37, 899]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Do not start the timer.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (y=900) to the middle of the screen (y=300) to open the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, including the Clock app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a grid of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Clock\\' app is now visible and accessible. The next step is to tap the \\'Clock\\' app icon.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[606,165],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clock\\' app icon located in the app drawer at approximately [606, 165]. This action is intended to open the Clock app. The \\'Clock\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clock\\' app icon at [606, 165] successfully opened the Clock application. The screen now shows the main interface of the Clock app, displaying the current time and navigation tabs at the bottom (\\'Alarm\\', \\'Clock\\', \\'Timer\\', \\'Stopwatch\\', \\'Bedtime\\'). This action has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user instruction by completing the first subgoal. The next step is to tap the \\'Timer\\' tab to navigate to the timer section.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[951,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Timer\\' tab, which is located at the bottom of the screen at approximately [951, 500]. This action is intended to switch from the current \\'Clock\\' view to the \\'Timer\\' view within the Clock app. The \\'Timer\\' tab is currently not selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Timer\\' tab at [951, 500] was successful. The Clock app navigated to the Timer section, which now displays a numpad for setting the timer duration. This action completed the active subgoal. The next step is to input the timer duration.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'1\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [338, 250]. This is the first digit of the \\'1635\\' sequence needed to set the timer to 00 hours, 16 minutes, and 35 seconds. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'1\\' on the numpad at [338, 250] changed the timer display from \"00h 00m 00s\" to \"00h 00m 01s\". A play button also appeared, indicating the timer is ready to be started. While this action did input a digit, it was not the correct first digit according to the right-to-left input method (seconds, minutes, hours). The intended time is 00h 16m 35s. The input \\'1\\' was interpreted as 1 second. To correct this and proceed, the \\'1\\' needs to be cleared using the backspace button before entering the correct sequence (3, 5, 1, 6, 0, 0).\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button (icon with a left arrow and cross) located at approximately [686, 757] on the numpad. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. This action is intended to clear the \\'01s\\' input, resetting the timer display to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button (icon with a left arrow and cross) at approximately [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 01s\\' to \\'00h 00m 00s\\', effectively clearing the previous incorrect input. This action corrected the state and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The device is now ready for the correct sequence of digits to be entered for the timer.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,755],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'3\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [340, 755]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clock\\' app icon at [606, 165] successfully opened the Clock application. The screen now shows the main interface of the Clock app, displaying the current time and navigation tabs at the bottom (\\'Alarm\\', \\'Clock\\', \\'Timer\\', \\'Stopwatch\\', \\'Bedtime\\'). This action has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user instruction by completing the first subgoal. The next step is to tap the \\'Timer\\' tab to navigate to the timer section.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[951,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Timer\\' tab, which is located at the bottom of the screen at approximately [951, 500]. This action is intended to switch from the current \\'Clock\\' view to the \\'Timer\\' view within the Clock app. The \\'Timer\\' tab is currently not selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Timer\\' tab at [951, 500] was successful. The Clock app navigated to the Timer section, which now displays a numpad for setting the timer duration. This action completed the active subgoal. The next step is to input the timer duration.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'1\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [338, 250]. This is the first digit of the \\'1635\\' sequence needed to set the timer to 00 hours, 16 minutes, and 35 seconds. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'1\\' on the numpad at [338, 250] changed the timer display from \"00h 00m 00s\" to \"00h 00m 01s\". A play button also appeared, indicating the timer is ready to be started. While this action did input a digit, it was not the correct first digit according to the right-to-left input method (seconds, minutes, hours). The intended time is 00h 16m 35s. The input \\'1\\' was interpreted as 1 second. To correct this and proceed, the \\'1\\' needs to be cleared using the backspace button before entering the correct sequence (3, 5, 1, 6, 0, 0).\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button (icon with a left arrow and cross) located at approximately [686, 757] on the numpad. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. This action is intended to clear the \\'01s\\' input, resetting the timer display to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button (icon with a left arrow and cross) at approximately [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 01s\\' to \\'00h 00m 00s\\', effectively clearing the previous incorrect input. This action corrected the state and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The device is now ready for the correct sequence of digits to be entered for the timer.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,755],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'3\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [340, 755]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'3\\' on the numpad at approximately [340, 755] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 00s\\' to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. A play button also appeared below the timer display. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly inputting the first digit of the seconds. The next step is to input \\'5\\'.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.43\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 55, 100, 204], \\'text\\': \\'Timer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [174, 154, 228, 862], \\'text\\': \\'OOn OOm 03s\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 474, 357, 528], \\'text\\': \\'2\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 727, 356, 784], \\'text\\': \\'3\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [438, 474, 472, 528], \\'text\\': \\'5\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [553, 472, 586, 530], \\'text\\': \\'8\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [667, 185, 704, 310], \\'text\\': \\'00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [667, 457, 704, 536], \\'text\\': \\'0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 51, 959, 150], \\'text\\': \\'Alarm\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 250, 959, 349], \\'text\\': \\'Clock\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [941, 448, 960, 551], \\'text\\': \\'Timer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [942, 607, 962, 971], \\'text\\': \\'Stopwatch Bedtime\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [764, 382, 870, 621]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [631, 632, 742, 882]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 585, 967, 807]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 401, 968, 590]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [894, 199, 974, 393]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [892, 4, 982, 199]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 809, 966, 978]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Do not start the timer.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[606,165],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Clock\\' app icon located in the app drawer at approximately [606, 165]. This action is intended to open the Clock app. The \\'Clock\\' app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Clock\\' app icon at [606, 165] successfully opened the Clock application. The screen now shows the main interface of the Clock app, displaying the current time and navigation tabs at the bottom (\\'Alarm\\', \\'Clock\\', \\'Timer\\', \\'Stopwatch\\', \\'Bedtime\\'). This action has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user instruction by completing the first subgoal. The next step is to tap the \\'Timer\\' tab to navigate to the timer section.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[951,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Timer\\' tab, which is located at the bottom of the screen at approximately [951, 500]. This action is intended to switch from the current \\'Clock\\' view to the \\'Timer\\' view within the Clock app. The \\'Timer\\' tab is currently not selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Timer\\' tab at [951, 500] was successful. The Clock app navigated to the Timer section, which now displays a numpad for setting the timer duration. This action completed the active subgoal. The next step is to input the timer duration.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'1\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [338, 250]. This is the first digit of the \\'1635\\' sequence needed to set the timer to 00 hours, 16 minutes, and 35 seconds. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'1\\' on the numpad at [338, 250] changed the timer display from \"00h 00m 00s\" to \"00h 00m 01s\". A play button also appeared, indicating the timer is ready to be started. While this action did input a digit, it was not the correct first digit according to the right-to-left input method (seconds, minutes, hours). The intended time is 00h 16m 35s. The input \\'1\\' was interpreted as 1 second. To correct this and proceed, the \\'1\\' needs to be cleared using the backspace button before entering the correct sequence (3, 5, 1, 6, 0, 0).\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button (icon with a left arrow and cross) located at approximately [686, 757] on the numpad. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. This action is intended to clear the \\'01s\\' input, resetting the timer display to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button (icon with a left arrow and cross) at approximately [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 01s\\' to \\'00h 00m 00s\\', effectively clearing the previous incorrect input. This action corrected the state and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The device is now ready for the correct sequence of digits to be entered for the timer.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,755],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'3\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [340, 755]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'3\\' on the numpad at approximately [340, 755] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 00s\\' to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. A play button also appeared below the timer display. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly inputting the first digit of the seconds. The next step is to input \\'5\\'.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[455,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'5\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [455, 501]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

A play button also appeared, indicating the timer is ready to be started. While this action did input a digit, it was not the correct first digit according to the right-to-left input method (seconds, minutes, hours). The intended time is 00h 16m 35s. The input \\'1\\' was interpreted as 1 second. To correct this and proceed, the \\'1\\' needs to be cleared using the backspace button before entering the correct sequence (3, 5, 1, 6, 0, 0).\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. This action is intended to clear the \\'01s\\' input, resetting the timer display to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button (icon with a left arrow and cross) at approximately [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 01s\\' to \\'00h 00m 00s\\', effectively clearing the previous incorrect input. This action corrected the state and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The device is now ready for the correct sequence of digits to be entered for the timer.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,755],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'3\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [340, 755]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'3\\' on the numpad at approximately [340, 755] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 00s\\' to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. A play button also appeared below the timer display. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly inputting the first digit of the seconds. The next step is to input \\'5\\'.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[455,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'5\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [455, 501]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'5\\' on the numpad at approximately [455, 501] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 03s\\' to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly inputting the second digit of the seconds. The next step is to input \\'1\\' for the minutes.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'1\\' on the numpad at [338, 250] changed the timer display from \"00h 00m 00s\" to \"00h 00m 01s\". A play button also appeared, indicating the timer is ready to be started. While this action did input a digit, it was not the correct first digit according to the right-to-left input method (seconds, minutes, hours). The intended time is 00h 16m 35s.

The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. This action is intended to clear the \\'01s\\' input, resetting the timer display to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button (icon with a left arrow and cross) at approximately [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 01s\\' to \\'00h 00m 00s\\', effectively clearing the previous incorrect input. This action corrected the state and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.

The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'5\\' on the numpad at approximately [455, 501] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 03s\\' to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly inputting the second digit of the seconds. The next step is to input \\'1\\' for the minutes.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 01m 35s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'1\\' on the numpad at [338, 250] was executed. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 35s\\' to \\'00h 03m 51s\\'. This happened because the sequence of typed digits (\\'3\\', \\'5\\', then \\'1\\') formed the number 351, which the system parsed as 3 minutes and 51 seconds. While the tap itself was successful, the resulting timer value is incorrect for the user\\'s goal of 00h 16m 35s. This action helped clarify the timer input mechanism.

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.44\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 55, 100, 204], \\'text\\': \\'Timer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [174, 154, 228, 859], \\'text\\': \\'OOn 03m 51s\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 474, 357, 528], \\'text\\': \\'2\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 727, 357, 782], \\'text\\': \\'3\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [438, 474, 472, 528], \\'text\\': \\'5\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [553, 472, 586, 530], \\'text\\': \\'8\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [667, 185, 704, 310], \\'text\\': \\'00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [667, 457, 704, 536], \\'text\\': \\'0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 51, 959, 150], \\'text\\': \\'Alarm\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 250, 959, 349], \\'text\\': \\'Clock\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [941, 448, 960, 551], \\'text\\': \\'Timer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [942, 607, 962, 971], \\'text\\': \\'Stopwatch Bedtime\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [764, 381, 870, 621]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [631, 632, 742, 882]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 585, 967, 807]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 400, 968, 590]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [894, 199, 973, 393]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [892, 4, 981, 198]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 809, 966, 978]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'1\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [338, 250]. This is the first digit of the \\'1635\\' sequence needed to set the timer to 00 hours, 16 minutes, and 35 seconds. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'1\\' on the numpad at [338, 250] changed the timer display from \"00h 00m 00s\" to \"00h 00m 01s\". A play button also appeared, indicating the timer is ready to be started. While this action did input a digit, it was not the correct first digit according to the right-to-left input method (seconds, minutes, hours). The intended time is 00h 16m 35s. The input \\'1\\' was interpreted as 1 second. To correct this and proceed, the \\'1\\' needs to be cleared using the backspace button before entering the correct sequence (3, 5, 1, 6, 0, 0).\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button (icon with a left arrow and cross) located at approximately [686, 757] on the numpad. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. This action is intended to clear the \\'01s\\' input, resetting the timer display to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button (icon with a left arrow and cross) at approximately [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 01s\\' to \\'00h 00m 00s\\', effectively clearing the previous incorrect input. This action corrected the state and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The device is now ready for the correct sequence of digits to be entered for the timer.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,755],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'3\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [340, 755]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'3\\' on the numpad at approximately [340, 755] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 00s\\' to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. A play button also appeared below the timer display. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly inputting the first digit of the seconds. The next step is to input \\'5\\'.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[455,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'5\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [455, 501]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'5\\' on the numpad at approximately [455, 501] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 03s\\' to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly inputting the second digit of the seconds. The next step is to input \\'1\\' for the minutes.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'1\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [338, 250]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 01m 35s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'1\\' on the numpad at [338, 250] was executed. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 35s\\' to \\'00h 03m 51s\\'. This happened because the sequence of typed digits (\\'3\\', \\'5\\', then \\'1\\') formed the number 351, which the system parsed as 3 minutes and 51 seconds. While the tap itself was successful, the resulting timer value is incorrect for the user\\'s goal of 00h 16m 35s. This action helped clarify the timer input mechanism. The current input needs to be cleared before entering the correct sequence.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 03m 51s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'1\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This means the last digit (\\'1\\') of the previously entered sequence \\'351\\' was deleted, leaving \\'35\\'. This brings the agent closer to being able to input the correct timer duration. The next step is to continue clearing the remaining digits.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.46\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 55, 100, 204], \\'text\\': \\'Timer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 155, 228, 858], \\'text\\': \\'OOn OOm 35s\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 474, 357, 528], \\'text\\': \\'2\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 727, 357, 782], \\'text\\': \\'3\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [438, 474, 472, 528], \\'text\\': \\'5\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [553, 472, 586, 530], \\'text\\': \\'8\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [667, 185, 704, 310], \\'text\\': \\'00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [667, 457, 704, 536], \\'text\\': \\'0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 51, 959, 150], \\'text\\': \\'Alarm\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 250, 959, 349], \\'text\\': \\'Clock\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [941, 448, 960, 551], \\'text\\': \\'Timer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [942, 607, 962, 971], \\'text\\': \\'Stopwatch Bedtime\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [764, 382, 870, 621]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [631, 632, 742, 882]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 585, 967, 807]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 401, 968, 590]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [894, 199, 973, 392]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [892, 4, 982, 198]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 810, 967, 977]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button (icon with a left arrow and cross) located at approximately [686, 757] on the numpad. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. This action is intended to clear the \\'01s\\' input, resetting the timer display to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button (icon with a left arrow and cross) at approximately [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 01s\\' to \\'00h 00m 00s\\', effectively clearing the previous incorrect input. This action corrected the state and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The device is now ready for the correct sequence of digits to be entered for the timer.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,755],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'3\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [340, 755]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'3\\' on the numpad at approximately [340, 755] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 00s\\' to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. A play button also appeared below the timer display. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly inputting the first digit of the seconds.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[455,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'5\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [455, 501]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'5\\' on the numpad at approximately [455, 501] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 03s\\' to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly inputting the second digit of the seconds. The next step is to input \\'1\\' for the minutes.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 01m 35s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'1\\' on the numpad at [338, 250] was executed. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 35s\\' to \\'00h 03m 51s\\'. This happened because the sequence of typed digits (\\'3\\', \\'5\\', then \\'1\\') formed the number 351, which the system parsed as 3 minutes and 51 seconds. While the tap itself was successful, the resulting timer value is incorrect for the user\\'s goal of 00h 16m 35s. This action helped clarify the timer input mechanism. The current input needs to be cleared before entering the correct sequence.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The timer currently displays \\'00h 03m 51s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'1\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 03m 51s\\' to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. This means the last digit (\\'1\\') of the previously entered sequence \\'351\\' was deleted, leaving \\'35\\'. This brings the agent closer to being able to input the correct timer duration. The next step is to continue clearing the remaining digits.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Do not start the timer.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[340,755],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'3\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [340, 755]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'3\\' on the numpad at approximately [340, 755] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 00s\\' to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. A play button also appeared below the timer display. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly inputting the first digit of the seconds. The next step is to input \\'5\\'.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[455,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'5\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [455, 501]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'5\\' on the numpad at approximately [455, 501] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 03s\\' to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly inputting the second digit of the seconds. The next step is to input \\'1\\' for the minutes.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'1\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [338, 250]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 01m 35s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'1\\' on the numpad at [338, 250] was executed. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 35s\\' to \\'00h 03m 51s\\'. This happened because the sequence of typed digits (\\'3\\', \\'5\\', then \\'1\\') formed the number 351, which the system parsed as 3 minutes and 51 seconds. While the tap itself was successful, the resulting timer value is incorrect for the user\\'s goal of 00h 16m 35s. This action helped clarify the timer input mechanism. The current input needs to be cleared before entering the correct sequence.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 03m 51s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'1\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 03m 51s\\' to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. This means the last digit (\\'1\\') of the previously entered sequence \\'351\\' was deleted, leaving \\'35\\'. This brings the agent closer to being able to input the correct timer duration. The next step is to continue clearing the remaining digits.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'5\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 35s\\' to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by further clearing the incorrect input. The next step is to clear the remaining digit.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[455,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'5\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [455, 501]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'5\\' on the numpad at approximately [455, 501] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 03s\\' to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly inputting the second digit of the seconds. The next step is to input \\'1\\' for the minutes.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'1\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [338, 250]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 01m 35s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'1\\' on the numpad at [338, 250] was executed. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 35s\\' to \\'00h 03m 51s\\'. This happened because the sequence of typed digits (\\'3\\', \\'5\\', then \\'1\\') formed the number 351, which the system parsed as 3 minutes and 51 seconds. While the tap itself was successful, the resulting timer value is incorrect for the user\\'s goal of 00h 16m 35s. This action helped clarify the timer input mechanism. The current input needs to be cleared before entering the correct sequence.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 03m 51s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'1\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 03m 51s\\' to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. This means the last digit (\\'1\\') of the previously entered sequence \\'351\\' was deleted, leaving \\'35\\'. This brings the agent closer to being able to input the correct timer duration. The next step is to continue clearing the remaining digits.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757].

Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 35s\\' to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by further clearing the incorrect input. The next step is to clear the remaining digit.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'3\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 03s\\' to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. This action successfully cleared the last digit of the previous input, resetting the timer to zero. This allows the agent to proceed with inputting the correct timer duration. The play button also disappeared, which is expected when the timer is zero.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Do not start the timer.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[455,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'5\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [455, 501]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'5\\' on the numpad at approximately [455, 501] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 03s\\' to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by correctly inputting the second digit of the seconds. The next step is to input \\'1\\' for the minutes.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'1\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [338, 250]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 01m 35s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'1\\' on the numpad at [338, 250] was executed. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 35s\\' to \\'00h 03m 51s\\'. This happened because the sequence of typed digits (\\'3\\', \\'5\\', then \\'1\\') formed the number 351, which the system parsed as 3 minutes and 51 seconds. While the tap itself was successful, the resulting timer value is incorrect for the user\\'s goal of 00h 16m 35s. This action helped clarify the timer input mechanism. The current input needs to be cleared before entering the correct sequence.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 03m 51s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'1\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 03m 51s\\' to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. This means the last digit (\\'1\\') of the previously entered sequence \\'351\\' was deleted, leaving \\'35\\'. This brings the agent closer to being able to input the correct timer duration. The next step is to continue clearing the remaining digits.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'5\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 35s\\' to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by further clearing the incorrect input. The next step is to clear the remaining digit.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'3\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 03s\\' to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. This action successfully cleared the last digit of the previous input, resetting the timer to zero. This allows the agent to proceed with inputting the correct timer duration. The play button also disappeared, which is expected when the timer is zero.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'1\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [338, 250]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 01s\\' as the first digit of \\'1635\\' is entered.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16.

The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 01m 35s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'1\\' on the numpad at [338, 250] was executed. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 35s\\' to \\'00h 03m 51s\\'. This happened because the sequence of typed digits (\\'3\\', \\'5\\', then \\'1\\') formed the number 351, which the system parsed as 3 minutes and 51 seconds. While the tap itself was successful, the resulting timer value is incorrect for the user\\'s goal of 00h 16m 35s. This action helped clarify the timer input mechanism. The current input needs to be cleared before entering the correct sequence.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 03m 51s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'1\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 03m 51s\\' to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. This means the last digit (\\'1\\') of the previously entered sequence \\'351\\' was deleted, leaving \\'35\\'. This brings the agent closer to being able to input the correct timer duration. The next step is to continue clearing the remaining digits.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'5\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 35s\\' to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by further clearing the incorrect input. The next step is to clear the remaining digit.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'3\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 03s\\' to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. This action successfully cleared the last digit of the previous input, resetting the timer to zero. This allows the agent to proceed with inputting the correct timer duration. The play button also disappeared, which is expected when the timer is zero.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'1\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [338, 250]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 01s\\' as the first digit of \\'1635\\' is entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'1\\' on the numpad at approximately [338, 250] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 00s\\' to \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. This correctly inputs the first digit of the sequence \\'1635\\' needed for the target time of 00h 16m 35s. A play button appeared, indicating the timer has a non-zero value and is ready to start, which aligns with the goal of setting the timer without starting it. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

Do not start the timer.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'1\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [338, 250]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 01m 35s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'1\\' on the numpad at [338, 250] was executed. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 35s\\' to \\'00h 03m 51s\\'. This happened because the sequence of typed digits (\\'3\\', \\'5\\', then \\'1\\') formed the number 351, which the system parsed as 3 minutes and 51 seconds. While the tap itself was successful, the resulting timer value is incorrect for the user\\'s goal of 00h 16m 35s. This action helped clarify the timer input mechanism. The current input needs to be cleared before entering the correct sequence.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 03m 51s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'1\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 03m 51s\\' to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. This means the last digit (\\'1\\') of the previously entered sequence \\'351\\' was deleted, leaving \\'35\\'. This brings the agent closer to being able to input the correct timer duration. The next step is to continue clearing the remaining digits.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'5\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 35s\\' to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by further clearing the incorrect input. The next step is to clear the remaining digit.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'3\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 03s\\' to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. This action successfully cleared the last digit of the previous input, resetting the timer to zero. This allows the agent to proceed with inputting the correct timer duration. The play button also disappeared, which is expected when the timer is zero.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'1\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [338, 250]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 01s\\' as the first digit of \\'1635\\' is entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'1\\' on the numpad at approximately [338, 250] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 00s\\' to \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. This correctly inputs the first digit of the sequence \\'1635\\' needed for the target time of 00h 16m 35s. A play button appeared, indicating the timer has a non-zero value and is ready to start, which aligns with the goal of setting the timer without starting it. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[455,754],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'6\\' button on the numpad, estimated to be at [455, 754]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. After this action, the input sequence will be \\'16\\', and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 16s\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Clock App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Clock app is open and visible on the screen.

This clarified the input mechanism: digits are concatenated (e.g., \\'351\\') and then parsed from right to left (SS, MM, HH). The target time 00h 16m 35s requires forming the number 1635 by typing \\'1\\', \\'6\\', \\'3\\', \\'5\\'. The incorrect input \\'351\\' (00h 03m 51s) was cleared by tapping backspace three times, resulting in \\'35\\' (00h 00m 35s), then \\'3\\' (00h 00m 03s), and finally \\'0\\' (00h 00m 00s).

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 03m 51s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'1\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 03m 51s\\' to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. This means the last digit (\\'1\\') of the previously entered sequence \\'351\\' was deleted, leaving \\'35\\'. This brings the agent closer to being able to input the correct timer duration. The next step is to continue clearing the remaining digits.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'5\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 35s\\' to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by further clearing the incorrect input. The next step is to clear the remaining digit.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'3\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 03s\\' to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. This action successfully cleared the last digit of the previous input, resetting the timer to zero. This allows the agent to proceed with inputting the correct timer duration. The play button also disappeared, which is expected when the timer is zero.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'1\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [338, 250]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 01s\\' as the first digit of \\'1635\\' is entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'1\\' on the numpad at approximately [338, 250] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 00s\\' to \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. This correctly inputs the first digit of the sequence \\'1635\\' needed for the target time of 00h 16m 35s. A play button appeared, indicating the timer has a non-zero value and is ready to start, which aligns with the goal of setting the timer without starting it. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[455,754],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'6\\' button on the numpad, estimated to be at [455, 754]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. After this action, the input sequence will be \\'16\\', and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 16s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'6\\' on the numpad at approximately [455, 754] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 01s\\' to \\'00h 00m 16s\\'. This correctly inputs the second digit of the sequence \\'1635\\' needed for the target time of 00h 16m 35s. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 43, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.55\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 55, 100, 204], \\'text\\': \\'Timer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 155, 228, 859], \\'text\\': \\'OOn OOm 16s\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 474, 357, 528], \\'text\\': \\'2\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 727, 357, 782], \\'text\\': \\'3\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [438, 474, 472, 528], \\'text\\': \\'5\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [553, 472, 586, 530], \\'text\\': \\'8\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [667, 185, 704, 310], \\'text\\': \\'00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [667, 457, 704, 536], \\'text\\': \\'0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 51, 959, 150], \\'text\\': \\'Alarm\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 250, 959, 349], \\'text\\': \\'Clock\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [941, 448, 960, 551], \\'text\\': \\'Timer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [942, 607, 962, 971], \\'text\\': \\'Stopwatch Bedtime\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [764, 382, 870, 621]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [631, 632, 742, 882]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 584, 967, 807]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 399, 967, 591]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [894, 198, 973, 393]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [892, 4, 981, 199]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 808, 966, 978]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Do not start the timer.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 03m 51s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'1\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 03m 51s\\' to \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. This means the last digit (\\'1\\') of the previously entered sequence \\'351\\' was deleted, leaving \\'35\\'. This brings the agent closer to being able to input the correct timer duration. The next step is to continue clearing the remaining digits.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'5\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 35s\\' to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by further clearing the incorrect input. The next step is to clear the remaining digit.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'3\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 03s\\' to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. This action successfully cleared the last digit of the previous input, resetting the timer to zero. This allows the agent to proceed with inputting the correct timer duration. The play button also disappeared, which is expected when the timer is zero.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'1\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [338, 250]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 01s\\' as the first digit of \\'1635\\' is entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'1\\' on the numpad at approximately [338, 250] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 00s\\' to \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. This correctly inputs the first digit of the sequence \\'1635\\' needed for the target time of 00h 16m 35s. A play button appeared, indicating the timer has a non-zero value and is ready to start, which aligns with the goal of setting the timer without starting it. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[455,754],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'6\\' button on the numpad, estimated to be at [455, 754]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. After this action, the input sequence will be \\'16\\', and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 16s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'6\\' on the numpad at approximately [455, 754] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 01s\\' to \\'00h 00m 16s\\'. This correctly inputs the second digit of the sequence \\'1635\\' needed for the target time of 00h 16m 35s. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 13: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,754],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'3\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [338, 754]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 16s\\'. After this action, the input sequence will be \\'163\\', and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 16m 30s\\'.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'5\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 35s\\' to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by further clearing the incorrect input. The next step is to clear the remaining digit.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'3\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 03s\\' to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. This action successfully cleared the last digit of the previous input, resetting the timer to zero. This allows the agent to proceed with inputting the correct timer duration. The play button also disappeared, which is expected when the timer is zero.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'1\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [338, 250]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 01s\\' as the first digit of \\'1635\\' is entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'1\\' on the numpad at approximately [338, 250] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 00s\\' to \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. This correctly inputs the first digit of the sequence \\'1635\\' needed for the target time of 00h 16m 35s. A play button appeared, indicating the timer has a non-zero value and is ready to start, which aligns with the goal of setting the timer without starting it. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[455,754],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'6\\' button on the numpad, estimated to be at [455, 754]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. After this action, the input sequence will be \\'16\\', and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 16s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'6\\' on the numpad at approximately [455, 754] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 01s\\' to \\'00h 00m 16s\\'. This correctly inputs the second digit of the sequence \\'1635\\' needed for the target time of 00h 16m 35s. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,754],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'3\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [338, 754]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 16s\\'. After this action, the input sequence will be \\'163\\', and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 16m 30s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'3\\' on the numpad at approximately [338, 754] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 16s\\' to \\'00h 01m 63s\\'. This correctly inputs the third digit of the sequence \\'1635\\' needed for the target time of 00h 16m 35s. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 43, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.55\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 55, 100, 204], \\'text\\': \\'Timer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 155, 228, 859], \\'text\\': \\'OOn Olm 63s\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 474, 357, 528], \\'text\\': \\'2\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 727, 357, 784], \\'text\\': \\'3\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [438, 474, 472, 528], \\'text\\': \\'5\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [553, 472, 586, 530], \\'text\\': \\'8\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [667, 185, 704, 310], \\'text\\': \\'00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [667, 457, 704, 536], \\'text\\': \\'0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 51, 959, 150], \\'text\\': \\'Alarm\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 250, 959, 349], \\'text\\': \\'Clock\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [941, 448, 960, 551], \\'text\\': \\'Timer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [942, 607, 962, 971], \\'text\\': \\'Stopwatch Bedtime\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [764, 381, 870, 621]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [631, 632, 742, 882]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 585, 967, 807]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 400, 967, 590]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [894, 199, 973, 393]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [892, 4, 981, 198]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 809, 967, 977]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Do not start the timer.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 35s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'5\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 35s\\' to \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by further clearing the incorrect input. The next step is to clear the remaining digit.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'3\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 03s\\' to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. This action successfully cleared the last digit of the previous input, resetting the timer to zero. This allows the agent to proceed with inputting the correct timer duration. The play button also disappeared, which is expected when the timer is zero.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'1\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [338, 250]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 01s\\' as the first digit of \\'1635\\' is entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'1\\' on the numpad at approximately [338, 250] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 00s\\' to \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. This correctly inputs the first digit of the sequence \\'1635\\' needed for the target time of 00h 16m 35s. A play button appeared, indicating the timer has a non-zero value and is ready to start, which aligns with the goal of setting the timer without starting it. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[455,754],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'6\\' button on the numpad, estimated to be at [455, 754]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. After this action, the input sequence will be \\'16\\', and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 16s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'6\\' on the numpad at approximately [455, 754] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 01s\\' to \\'00h 00m 16s\\'. This correctly inputs the second digit of the sequence \\'1635\\' needed for the target time of 00h 16m 35s. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,754],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'3\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [338, 754]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 16s\\'. After this action, the input sequence will be \\'163\\', and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 16m 30s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'3\\' on the numpad at approximately [338, 754] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 16s\\' to \\'00h 01m 63s\\'. This correctly inputs the third digit of the sequence \\'1635\\' needed for the target time of 00h 16m 35s. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 14: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[455,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'5\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [455, 501]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 01m 63s\\'. After this action, the input sequence will be \\'1635\\', and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 16m 35s\\'.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[686,757],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the backspace button, located at approximately [686, 757]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 03s\\'. This action will delete the last entered digit (\\'3\\'), and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the backspace button at [686, 757] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 03s\\' to \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. This action successfully cleared the last digit of the previous input, resetting the timer to zero. This allows the agent to proceed with inputting the correct timer duration. The play button also disappeared, which is expected when the timer is zero.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'1\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [338, 250]. The timer display is currently \\'00h 00m 00s\\'. After this action, the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 01s\\' as the first digit of \\'1635\\' is entered. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'1\\' on the numpad at approximately [338, 250] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 00s\\' to \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. This correctly inputs the first digit of the sequence \\'1635\\' needed for the target time of 00h 16m 35s. A play button appeared, indicating the timer has a non-zero value and is ready to start, which aligns with the goal of setting the timer without starting it. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[455,754],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'6\\' button on the numpad, estimated to be at [455, 754]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 01s\\'. After this action, the input sequence will be \\'16\\', and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 00m 16s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'6\\' on the numpad at approximately [455, 754] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 01s\\' to \\'00h 00m 16s\\'. This correctly inputs the second digit of the sequence \\'1635\\' needed for the target time of 00h 16m 35s. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[338,754],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'3\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [338, 754]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 00m 16s\\'. After this action, the input sequence will be \\'163\\', and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 16m 30s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'3\\' on the numpad at approximately [338, 754] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 00m 16s\\' to \\'00h 01m 63s\\'. This correctly inputs the third digit of the sequence \\'1635\\' needed for the target time of 00h 16m 35s. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[455,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'5\\' button on the numpad, located at approximately [455, 501]. The timer currently displays \\'00h 01m 63s\\'. After this action, the input sequence will be \\'1635\\', and the timer display is predicted to change to \\'00h 16m 35s\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'5\\' on the numpad at approximately [455, 501] was successful. The timer display changed from \\'00h 01m 63s\\' to \\'00h 16m 35s\\'. This correctly inputs the final digit of the sequence \\'1635\\' needed for the target time of 00h 16m 35s. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, and in fact, completed it.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.56\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 55, 100, 204], \\'text\\': \\'Timer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 154, 229, 859], \\'text\\': \\'OOn 16m 35s\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 474, 357, 528], \\'text\\': \\'2\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [323, 727, 357, 782], \\'text\\': \\'3\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [438, 474, 472, 528], \\'text\\': \\'5\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [553, 472, 586, 530], \\'text\\': \\'8\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [667, 185, 704, 310], \\'text\\': \\'00\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [667, 457, 704, 536], \\'text\\': \\'0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 51, 959, 150], \\'text\\': \\'Alarm\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [943, 250, 959, 349], \\'text\\': \\'Clock\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [941, 448, 960, 551], \\'text\\': \\'Timer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [942, 607, 962, 971], \\'text\\': \\'Stopwatch Bedtime\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [764, 381, 870, 621]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [631, 632, 742, 882]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 585, 967, 807]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 400, 967, 590]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [894, 199, 973, 393]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [892, 4, 981, 198]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 810, 967, 977]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
