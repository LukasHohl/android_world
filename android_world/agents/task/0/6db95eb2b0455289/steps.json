Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` was performed. However, comparing the screen before and after the action, the \\'X\\' element did not move from its position in the top-left cell of the grid. The screen content remained unchanged.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,455],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Right\\' button, which has text \\'Right\\' and bounding box `[335, 413, 354, 496]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell to the right in the grid, from (row 1, col 1) to (row 1, col 2). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Right\\' button at `[345, 455]` was successful. The \\'X\\' element on the screen moved one cell to the right, from the top-left cell (row 1, column 1) to the cell (row 1, column 2). This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it confirms that at least one of the navigation buttons is interactive. The previous failures with the \\'Down\\' button might have been due to a specific issue with that button or an initial state where buttons were not responsive.\\n Step 72: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 353, 229]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid, from (row 1, col 2) to (row 2, col 2). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` was performed. However, the \\'X\\' element on the screen did not move from its position in cell (row 1, column 2). The screen content remained unchanged. This action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is the fourth consecutive failure for the \\'Down\\' tap, strongly suggesting the \\'Down\\' button is not interactive.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'17.16\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 712, 65, 797], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [120, 47, 152, 318], \\'text\\': \\'Tue; May 13\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 336, 722, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Gmail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 561, 722, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [704, 781, 722, 921], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [775, 295, 872, 709], \\'text\\': \\'0 (9\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 72, 855, 232]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 764, 856, 929]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 298, 856, 466]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 535, 858, 706]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 536, 730, 694]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 764, 729, 927]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 299, 732, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 701, 948, 794]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [893, 802, 952, 921]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 822, 39, 900]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then click the button 5 times, remember the numbers displayed, and enter their product in the form.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 68: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 353, 229]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` did not result in any change on the screen. The \\'X\\' element remained in the top-left cell of the grid. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The \\'Down\\' button needs to be tapped again to attempt to move the \\'X\\' downwards.\\n Step 69: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 352, 228]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` was performed. However, comparing the screen before and after the action, the \\'X\\' element did not move from its position in the top-left cell of the grid. The screen content remained unchanged. This action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is the second consecutive failure for this specific \\'Down\\' tap. The \\'Down\\' button needs to be tapped again to attempt to move the \\'X\\' downwards.\\n Step 70: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 352, 228]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid from (row 1, col 1) to (row 2, col 1). This is the third attempt for this specific move. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` for the third time was performed. However, comparing the screen before and after the action, the \\'X\\' element did not move from its position in the top-left cell of the grid. The screen content remained unchanged. This action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is the third consecutive failure for the \\'Down\\' tap. The interactivity of the buttons is now highly questionable.\\n Step 71: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,455],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Right\\' button, which has text \\'Right\\' and bounding box `[335, 413, 354, 496]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell to the right in the grid, from (row 1, col 1) to (row 1, col 2). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Right\\' button at `[345, 455]` was successful. The \\'X\\' element on the screen moved one cell to the right, from the top-left cell (row 1, column 1) to the cell (row 1, column 2). This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it confirms that at least one of the navigation buttons is interactive. The previous failures with the \\'Down\\' button might have been due to a specific issue with that button or an initial state where buttons were not responsive.\\n Step 72: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 353, 229]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid, from (row 1, col 2) to (row 2, col 2). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` was performed. However, the \\'X\\' element on the screen did not move from its position in cell (row 1, column 2). The screen content remained unchanged. This action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is the fourth consecutive failure for the \\'Down\\' tap, strongly suggesting the \\'Down\\' button is not interactive.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 74: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the File Manager app can be found.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 352, 228]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` was performed. However, comparing the screen before and after the action, the \\'X\\' element did not move from its position in the top-left cell of the grid. The screen content remained unchanged. This action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is the second consecutive failure for this specific \\'Down\\' tap. The \\'Down\\' button needs to be tapped again to attempt to move the \\'X\\' downwards.\\n Step 70: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 352, 228]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid from (row 1, col 1) to (row 2, col 1). This is the third attempt for this specific move. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` for the third time was performed. However, comparing the screen before and after the action, the \\'X\\' element did not move from its position in the top-left cell of the grid. The screen content remained unchanged. This action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is the third consecutive failure for the \\'Down\\' tap. The interactivity of the buttons is now highly questionable.\\n Step 71: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,455],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Right\\' button, which has text \\'Right\\' and bounding box `[335, 413, 354, 496]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell to the right in the grid, from (row 1, col 1) to (row 1, col 2). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Right\\' button at `[345, 455]` was successful. The \\'X\\' element on the screen moved one cell to the right, from the top-left cell (row 1, column 1) to the cell (row 1, column 2). This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it confirms that at least one of the navigation buttons is interactive. The previous failures with the \\'Down\\' button might have been due to a specific issue with that button or an initial state where buttons were not responsive.\\n Step 72: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 353, 229]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid, from (row 1, col 2) to (row 2, col 2). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` was performed. However, the \\'X\\' element on the screen did not move from its position in cell (row 1, column 2). The screen content remained unchanged. This action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is the fourth consecutive failure for the \\'Down\\' tap, strongly suggesting the \\'Down\\' button is not interactive.\\n Step 73: Action: {\"name\":\"If the task requires it, use this to send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"I am unable to navigate the \\'X\\' to the bottom-right cell because the \\'Down\\' button on the page is not working. The \\'X\\' is currently at row 1, column 2.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Inform the user that the task cannot be completed because the \\'Down\\' button is non-functional. The \\'X\\' is currently at (row 1, col 2). This action will terminate the execution. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a view displaying multiple installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the File Manager app.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then click the button 5 times, remember the numbers displayed, and enter their product in the form.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 69: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 352, 228]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` was performed. However, comparing the screen before and after the action, the \\'X\\' element did not move from its position in the top-left cell of the grid. The screen content remained unchanged. This action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is the second consecutive failure for this specific \\'Down\\' tap. The \\'Down\\' button needs to be tapped again to attempt to move the \\'X\\' downwards.\\n Step 70: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 352, 228]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid from (row 1, col 1) to (row 2, col 1). This is the third attempt for this specific move. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` for the third time was performed. However, comparing the screen before and after the action, the \\'X\\' element did not move from its position in the top-left cell of the grid. The screen content remained unchanged. This action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is the third consecutive failure for the \\'Down\\' tap. The interactivity of the buttons is now highly questionable.\\n Step 71: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,455],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Right\\' button, which has text \\'Right\\' and bounding box `[335, 413, 354, 496]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell to the right in the grid, from (row 1, col 1) to (row 1, col 2). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Right\\' button at `[345, 455]` was successful. The \\'X\\' element on the screen moved one cell to the right, from the top-left cell (row 1, column 1) to the cell (row 1, column 2). This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it confirms that at least one of the navigation buttons is interactive. The previous failures with the \\'Down\\' button might have been due to a specific issue with that button or an initial state where buttons were not responsive.\\n Step 72: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 353, 229]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid, from (row 1, col 2) to (row 2, col 2). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` was performed. However, the \\'X\\' element on the screen did not move from its position in cell (row 1, column 2). The screen content remained unchanged. This action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is the fourth consecutive failure for the \\'Down\\' tap, strongly suggesting the \\'Down\\' button is not interactive.\\n Step 73: Action: {\"name\":\"If the task requires it, use this to send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"I am unable to navigate the \\'X\\' to the bottom-right cell because the \\'Down\\' button on the page is not working. The \\'X\\' is currently at row 1, column 2.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Inform the user that the task cannot be completed because the \\'Down\\' button is non-functional. The \\'X\\' is currently at (row 1, col 2). This action will terminate the execution. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a view displaying multiple installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the File Manager app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 75: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon, which has an associated icon bounding box `[685, 75, 788, 266]` and text \\'Files\\' at `[765, 124, 782, 205]`. This action is expected to open the \\'Files\\' app, which is the file manager.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 352, 228]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid from (row 1, col 1) to (row 2, col 1). This is the third attempt for this specific move. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` for the third time was performed. However, comparing the screen before and after the action, the \\'X\\' element did not move from its position in the top-left cell of the grid. The screen content remained unchanged. This action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is the third consecutive failure for the \\'Down\\' tap. The interactivity of the buttons is now highly questionable.\\n Step 71: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,455],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Right\\' button, which has text \\'Right\\' and bounding box `[335, 413, 354, 496]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell to the right in the grid, from (row 1, col 1) to (row 1, col 2). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Right\\' button at `[345, 455]` was successful. The \\'X\\' element on the screen moved one cell to the right, from the top-left cell (row 1, column 1) to the cell (row 1, column 2). This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it confirms that at least one of the navigation buttons is interactive. The previous failures with the \\'Down\\' button might have been due to a specific issue with that button or an initial state where buttons were not responsive.\\n Step 72: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 353, 229]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid, from (row 1, col 2) to (row 2, col 2). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` was performed. However, the \\'X\\' element on the screen did not move from its position in cell (row 1, column 2). The screen content remained unchanged. This action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is the fourth consecutive failure for the \\'Down\\' tap, strongly suggesting the \\'Down\\' button is not interactive.\\n Step 73: Action: {\"name\":\"If the task requires it, use this to send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"I am unable to navigate the \\'X\\' to the bottom-right cell because the \\'Down\\' button on the page is not working. The \\'X\\' is currently at row 1, column 2.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Inform the user that the task cannot be completed because the \\'Down\\' button is non-functional. The \\'X\\' is currently at (row 1, col 2). This action will terminate the execution. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a view displaying multiple installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the File Manager app.\\n Step 74: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the File Manager app can be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Files\\' app icon at `[736,170]` was successful. The \\'Files\\' app opened, and the screen now displays the \\'Downloads\\' folder content. The file \\'task.html\\' is visible on the screen. This action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (\\'Open File Manager App\\').\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'17:17\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 175, 91, 425], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [488, 175, 504, 326], \\'text\\': \\'task html\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 179, 523, 369], \\'text\\': \\'2.23 kB 17.15\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 545, 205, 780]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 313, 205, 533]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 795, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 792, 94, 858]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 861, 94, 971]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [490, 83, 523, 168]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 55, 143, 234]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 818, 40, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [48, 115, 94, 421]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [282, 58, 537, 497]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [232, 842, 259, 923]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [367, 216, 395, 278]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

Then click the button 5 times, remember the numbers displayed, and enter their product in the form.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 70: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 352, 228]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid from (row 1, col 1) to (row 2, col 1). This is the third attempt for this specific move. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` for the third time was performed. However, comparing the screen before and after the action, the \\'X\\' element did not move from its position in the top-left cell of the grid. The screen content remained unchanged. This action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is the third consecutive failure for the \\'Down\\' tap. The interactivity of the buttons is now highly questionable.\\n Step 71: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,455],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Right\\' button, which has text \\'Right\\' and bounding box `[335, 413, 354, 496]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell to the right in the grid, from (row 1, col 1) to (row 1, col 2). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Right\\' button at `[345, 455]` was successful. The \\'X\\' element on the screen moved one cell to the right, from the top-left cell (row 1, column 1) to the cell (row 1, column 2). This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it confirms that at least one of the navigation buttons is interactive. The previous failures with the \\'Down\\' button might have been due to a specific issue with that button or an initial state where buttons were not responsive.\\n Step 72: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 353, 229]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid, from (row 1, col 2) to (row 2, col 2). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` was performed. However, the \\'X\\' element on the screen did not move from its position in cell (row 1, column 2). The screen content remained unchanged. This action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is the fourth consecutive failure for the \\'Down\\' tap, strongly suggesting the \\'Down\\' button is not interactive.\\n Step 73: Action: {\"name\":\"If the task requires it, use this to send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"I am unable to navigate the \\'X\\' to the bottom-right cell because the \\'Down\\' button on the page is not working. The \\'X\\' is currently at row 1, column 2.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Inform the user that the task cannot be completed because the \\'Down\\' button is non-functional. The \\'X\\' is currently at (row 1, col 2). This action will terminate the execution. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a view displaying multiple installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the File Manager app.\\n Step 74: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the File Manager app can be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Files\\' app icon at `[736,170]` was successful. The \\'Files\\' app opened, and the screen now displays the \\'Downloads\\' folder content. The file \\'task.html\\' is visible on the screen. This action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (\\'Open File Manager App\\').\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 76: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'task.html\\' file, which has text \\'task html\\' and bounding box `[488, 175, 504, 326]`. This action is expected to open the file, likely prompting to choose an application to open it with. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open File Manager App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app (e.g., \\'Files\\') is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,455],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Right\\' button, which has text \\'Right\\' and bounding box `[335, 413, 354, 496]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell to the right in the grid, from (row 1, col 1) to (row 1, col 2). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Right\\' button at `[345, 455]` was successful. The \\'X\\' element on the screen moved one cell to the right, from the top-left cell (row 1, column 1) to the cell (row 1, column 2). This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it confirms that at least one of the navigation buttons is interactive. The previous failures with the \\'Down\\' button might have been due to a specific issue with that button or an initial state where buttons were not responsive.\\n Step 72: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 353, 229]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid, from (row 1, col 2) to (row 2, col 2). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` was performed. However, the \\'X\\' element on the screen did not move from its position in cell (row 1, column 2). The screen content remained unchanged. This action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is the fourth consecutive failure for the \\'Down\\' tap, strongly suggesting the \\'Down\\' button is not interactive.\\n Step 73: Action: {\"name\":\"If the task requires it, use this to send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"I am unable to navigate the \\'X\\' to the bottom-right cell because the \\'Down\\' button on the page is not working. The \\'X\\' is currently at row 1, column 2.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Inform the user that the task cannot be completed because the \\'Down\\' button is non-functional. The \\'X\\' is currently at (row 1, col 2). This action will terminate the execution. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a view displaying multiple installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the File Manager app.\\n Step 74: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the File Manager app can be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Files\\' app icon at `[736,170]` was successful. The \\'Files\\' app opened, and the screen now displays the \\'Downloads\\' folder content. The file \\'task.html\\' is visible on the screen. This action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (\\'Open File Manager App\\').\\n Step 75: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon, which has an associated icon bounding box `[685, 75, 788, 266]` and text \\'Files\\' at `[765, 124, 782, 205]`. This action is expected to open the \\'Files\\' app, which is the file manager. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'task.html\\' at [496, 250] did not result in any change on the screen. The file \\'task.html\\' did not open, and no \\'Open with\\' prompt appeared. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 41, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'17:18\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 175, 91, 425], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [488, 175, 504, 326], \\'text\\': \\'task:html\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 179, 523, 369], \\'text\\': \\'2.23 kB 17.15\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 545, 205, 780]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 313, 205, 533]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 795, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 791, 94, 858]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 861, 94, 971]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [490, 83, 523, 168]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 55, 143, 234]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 818, 40, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [48, 115, 94, 422]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [282, 59, 537, 496]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 142, 37, 185]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [232, 842, 259, 923]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [367, 216, 395, 278]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 37, 38, 136]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

Then click the button 5 times, remember the numbers displayed, and enter their product in the form.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 71: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,455],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Right\\' button, which has text \\'Right\\' and bounding box `[335, 413, 354, 496]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell to the right in the grid, from (row 1, col 1) to (row 1, col 2). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Right\\' button at `[345, 455]` was successful. The \\'X\\' element on the screen moved one cell to the right, from the top-left cell (row 1, column 1) to the cell (row 1, column 2). This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it confirms that at least one of the navigation buttons is interactive. The previous failures with the \\'Down\\' button might have been due to a specific issue with that button or an initial state where buttons were not responsive.\\n Step 72: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 353, 229]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid, from (row 1, col 2) to (row 2, col 2). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` was performed. However, the \\'X\\' element on the screen did not move from its position in cell (row 1, column 2). The screen content remained unchanged. This action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is the fourth consecutive failure for the \\'Down\\' tap, strongly suggesting the \\'Down\\' button is not interactive.\\n Step 73: Action: {\"name\":\"If the task requires it, use this to send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"I am unable to navigate the \\'X\\' to the bottom-right cell because the \\'Down\\' button on the page is not working. The \\'X\\' is currently at row 1, column 2.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Inform the user that the task cannot be completed because the \\'Down\\' button is non-functional. The \\'X\\' is currently at (row 1, col 2). This action will terminate the execution. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a view displaying multiple installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the File Manager app.\\n Step 74: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the File Manager app can be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Files\\' app icon at `[736,170]` was successful. The \\'Files\\' app opened, and the screen now displays the \\'Downloads\\' folder content. The file \\'task.html\\' is visible on the screen. This action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (\\'Open File Manager App\\').\\n Step 75: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon, which has an associated icon bounding box `[685, 75, 788, 266]` and text \\'Files\\' at `[765, 124, 782, 205]`. This action is expected to open the \\'Files\\' app, which is the file manager. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'task.html\\' at [496, 250] did not result in any change on the screen. The file \\'task.html\\' did not open, and no \\'Open with\\' prompt appeared. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 77: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[410,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'task.html\\' file item, which is located around `[410, 278]`. This action is expected to select the file and/or open a context menu with options like \\'Open\\', \\'Open with\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. The goal is to find an option to open the file. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open File Manager App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app (e.g., \\'Files\\') is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The tap action previously failed to open the file, so a long press was a good alternative to try.\\nNow that the file is selected, the next logical step is to find an 'Open' or 'Open with' command. This command is typically found in a context menu or an options menu. The 'more options' icon (three vertical dots) in the top right corner (bounding box `[66, 855, 94, 945]`) is the most likely place to find such a command.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 353, 229]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid, from (row 1, col 2) to (row 2, col 2). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` was performed. However, the \\'X\\' element on the screen did not move from its position in cell (row 1, column 2). The screen content remained unchanged. This action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is the fourth consecutive failure for the \\'Down\\' tap, strongly suggesting the \\'Down\\' button is not interactive.\\n Step 73: Action: {\"name\":\"If the task requires it, use this to send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"I am unable to navigate the \\'X\\' to the bottom-right cell because the \\'Down\\' button on the page is not working. The \\'X\\' is currently at row 1, column 2.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Inform the user that the task cannot be completed because the \\'Down\\' button is non-functional. The \\'X\\' is currently at (row 1, col 2). This action will terminate the execution. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a view displaying multiple installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the File Manager app.\\n Step 74: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the File Manager app can be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Files\\' app icon at `[736,170]` was successful. The \\'Files\\' app opened, and the screen now displays the \\'Downloads\\' folder content. The file \\'task.html\\' is visible on the screen. This action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (\\'Open File Manager App\\').\\n Step 75: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon, which has an associated icon bounding box `[685, 75, 788, 266]` and text \\'Files\\' at `[765, 124, 782, 205]`. This action is expected to open the \\'Files\\' app, which is the file manager. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'task.html\\' at [496, 250] did not result in any change on the screen. The file \\'task.html\\' did not open, and no \\'Open with\\' prompt appeared. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 76: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'task.html\\' file, which has text \\'task html\\' and bounding box `[488, 175, 504, 326]`. This action is expected to open the file, likely prompting to choose an application to open it with. Actual Outcome: The long press on \\'task.html\\' at `[410, 278]` successfully selected the file. This is evident from the blue highlight around \\'task.html\\', the checkmark next to it, the \\'1 selected\\' text appearing at the top of the screen, and the appearance of new action icons (share, delete). While this action didn\\'t directly open the file or show an \\'Open with\\' prompt, it brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling further interactions related to the selected file. The next step is to find the \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\' option, likely within a menu accessible via the \\'more options\\' icon.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 41, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'17:18\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 91, 381], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0 dY: 0.0 selected\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 710, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'IPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [488, 175, 504, 326], \\'text\\': \\'task html\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 179, 523, 369], \\'text\\': \\'2.23 kB 17.15\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 546, 205, 781]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 313, 205, 533]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 795, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [476, 54, 535, 496]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 791, 94, 851]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 37, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 855, 94, 945]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 140, 37, 186]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [232, 840, 259, 924]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [47, 116, 94, 393]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then click the button 5 times, remember the numbers displayed, and enter their product in the form.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 72: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 353, 229]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid, from (row 1, col 2) to (row 2, col 2). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` was performed. However, the \\'X\\' element on the screen did not move from its position in cell (row 1, column 2). The screen content remained unchanged. This action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is the fourth consecutive failure for the \\'Down\\' tap, strongly suggesting the \\'Down\\' button is not interactive.\\n Step 73: Action: {\"name\":\"If the task requires it, use this to send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"I am unable to navigate the \\'X\\' to the bottom-right cell because the \\'Down\\' button on the page is not working. The \\'X\\' is currently at row 1, column 2.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Inform the user that the task cannot be completed because the \\'Down\\' button is non-functional. The \\'X\\' is currently at (row 1, col 2). This action will terminate the execution. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a view displaying multiple installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the File Manager app.\\n Step 74: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the File Manager app can be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Files\\' app icon at `[736,170]` was successful. The \\'Files\\' app opened, and the screen now displays the \\'Downloads\\' folder content. The file \\'task.html\\' is visible on the screen. This action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (\\'Open File Manager App\\').\\n Step 75: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon, which has an associated icon bounding box `[685, 75, 788, 266]` and text \\'Files\\' at `[765, 124, 782, 205]`. This action is expected to open the \\'Files\\' app, which is the file manager. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'task.html\\' at [496, 250] did not result in any change on the screen. The file \\'task.html\\' did not open, and no \\'Open with\\' prompt appeared. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 76: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'task.html\\' file, which has text \\'task html\\' and bounding box `[488, 175, 504, 326]`. This action is expected to open the file, likely prompting to choose an application to open it with. Actual Outcome: The long press on \\'task.html\\' at `[410, 278]` successfully selected the file. This is evident from the blue highlight around \\'task.html\\', the checkmark next to it, the \\'1 selected\\' text appearing at the top of the screen, and the appearance of new action icons (share, delete). While this action didn\\'t directly open the file or show an \\'Open with\\' prompt, it brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling further interactions related to the selected file. The next step is to find the \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\' option, likely within a menu accessible via the \\'more options\\' icon.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 78: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located at approximately `[80, 900]` (bounding box `[66, 855, 94, 945]`). This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, hopefully including \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open File Manager App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app (e.g., \\'Files\\') is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

The \\'X\\' is currently at (row 1, col 2). This action will terminate the execution. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a view displaying multiple installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the File Manager app.\\n Step 74: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the File Manager app can be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Files\\' app icon at `[736,170]` was successful. The \\'Files\\' app opened, and the screen now displays the \\'Downloads\\' folder content. The file \\'task.html\\' is visible on the screen. This action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (\\'Open File Manager App\\').\\n Step 75: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon, which has an associated icon bounding box `[685, 75, 788, 266]` and text \\'Files\\' at `[765, 124, 782, 205]`. This action is expected to open the \\'Files\\' app, which is the file manager. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'task.html\\' at [496, 250] did not result in any change on the screen. The file \\'task.html\\' did not open, and no \\'Open with\\' prompt appeared. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 76: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'task.html\\' file, which has text \\'task html\\' and bounding box `[488, 175, 504, 326]`. This action is expected to open the file, likely prompting to choose an application to open it with. Actual Outcome: The long press on \\'task.html\\' at `[410, 278]` successfully selected the file. This is evident from the blue highlight around \\'task.html\\', the checkmark next to it, the \\'1 selected\\' text appearing at the top of the screen, and the appearance of new action icons (share, delete). While this action didn\\'t directly open the file or show an \\'Open with\\' prompt, it brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling further interactions related to the selected file. The next step is to find the \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\' option, likely within a menu accessible via the \\'more options\\' icon.\\n Step 77: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[410,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'task.html\\' file item, which is located around `[410, 278]`. This action is expected to select the file and/or open a context menu with options like \\'Open\\', \\'Open with\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. The goal is to find an option to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'more options\\' icon at `[80, 900]` was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen, displaying several options for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). The options include \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Open with\\' option is now accessible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'17:19\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 90, 381], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0 dY: 0.0 selected\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 710, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 549, 144, 712], \\'text\\': \\'Open with\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [176, 549, 196, 672], \\'text\\': \\'Sort by.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [229, 549, 246, 737], \\'text\\': \\'Deselect all\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [284, 637, 298, 678], \\'text\\': \\'to.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [335, 552, 351, 684], \\'text\\': \\'Move to.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [386, 547, 407, 716], \\'text\\': \\'Compress\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [440, 550, 455, 683], \\'text\\': \\'Rename\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [488, 175, 504, 326], \\'text\\': \\'task html\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [492, 551, 508, 678], \\'text\\': \\'Get info\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 179, 523, 369], \\'text\\': \\'2.23 kB 17.15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [280, 545, 302, 638], \\'text\\': \\'Copy\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [477, 51, 535, 492]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 855, 92, 972]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 314, 204, 520]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 193, 38, 244]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [108, 524, 157, 989]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 789, 93, 853]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 31, 38, 190]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [47, 116, 94, 394]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [159, 531, 213, 980]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then click the button 5 times, remember the numbers displayed, and enter their product in the form.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 73: Action: {\"name\":\"If the task requires it, use this to send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"I am unable to navigate the \\'X\\' to the bottom-right cell because the \\'Down\\' button on the page is not working. The \\'X\\' is currently at row 1, column 2.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Inform the user that the task cannot be completed because the \\'Down\\' button is non-functional. The \\'X\\' is currently at (row 1, col 2). This action will terminate the execution. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [900, 500] to [300, 500] successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a view displaying multiple installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the File Manager app.\\n Step 74: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the File Manager app can be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Files\\' app icon at `[736,170]` was successful. The \\'Files\\' app opened, and the screen now displays the \\'Downloads\\' folder content. The file \\'task.html\\' is visible on the screen. This action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (\\'Open File Manager App\\').\\n Step 75: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon, which has an associated icon bounding box `[685, 75, 788, 266]` and text \\'Files\\' at `[765, 124, 782, 205]`. This action is expected to open the \\'Files\\' app, which is the file manager. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'task.html\\' at [496, 250] did not result in any change on the screen. The file \\'task.html\\' did not open, and no \\'Open with\\' prompt appeared. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 76: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'task.html\\' file, which has text \\'task html\\' and bounding box `[488, 175, 504, 326]`. This action is expected to open the file, likely prompting to choose an application to open it with. Actual Outcome: The long press on \\'task.html\\' at `[410, 278]` successfully selected the file. This is evident from the blue highlight around \\'task.html\\', the checkmark next to it, the \\'1 selected\\' text appearing at the top of the screen, and the appearance of new action icons (share, delete). While this action didn\\'t directly open the file or show an \\'Open with\\' prompt, it brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling further interactions related to the selected file. The next step is to find the \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\' option, likely within a menu accessible via the \\'more options\\' icon.\\n Step 77: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[410,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'task.html\\' file item, which is located around `[410, 278]`. This action is expected to select the file and/or open a context menu with options like \\'Open\\', \\'Open with\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. The goal is to find an option to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'more options\\' icon at `[80, 900]` was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen, displaying several options for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). The options include \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Open with\\' option is now accessible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 79: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is located at bounding box `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. This action is expected to open a dialog or a list of applications that can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16.

This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the File Manager app can be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Files\\' app icon at `[736,170]` was successful. The \\'Files\\' app opened, and the screen now displays the \\'Downloads\\' folder content. The file \\'task.html\\' is visible on the screen. This action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (\\'Open File Manager App\\').\\n Step 75: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon, which has an associated icon bounding box `[685, 75, 788, 266]` and text \\'Files\\' at `[765, 124, 782, 205]`. This action is expected to open the \\'Files\\' app, which is the file manager. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'task.html\\' at [496, 250] did not result in any change on the screen. The file \\'task.html\\' did not open, and no \\'Open with\\' prompt appeared. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 76: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'task.html\\' file, which has text \\'task html\\' and bounding box `[488, 175, 504, 326]`. This action is expected to open the file, likely prompting to choose an application to open it with. Actual Outcome: The long press on \\'task.html\\' at `[410, 278]` successfully selected the file. This is evident from the blue highlight around \\'task.html\\', the checkmark next to it, the \\'1 selected\\' text appearing at the top of the screen, and the appearance of new action icons (share, delete). While this action didn\\'t directly open the file or show an \\'Open with\\' prompt, it brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling further interactions related to the selected file. The next step is to find the \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\' option, likely within a menu accessible via the \\'more options\\' icon.\\n Step 77: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[410,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'task.html\\' file item, which is located around `[410, 278]`. This action is expected to select the file and/or open a context menu with options like \\'Open\\', \\'Open with\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. The goal is to find an option to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'more options\\' icon at `[80, 900]` was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen, displaying several options for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). The options include \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Open with\\' option is now accessible.\\n Step 78: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located at approximately `[80, 900]` (bounding box `[66, 855, 94, 945]`). This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, hopefully including \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at `[134, 630]` was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, prompting the user to choose an application to open \\'task.html\\'. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully triggering the \\'Open with\\' prompt, which completes Subgoal 2.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 42, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'17.20\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'IXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 205, 91, 379], \\'text\\': \\'selected\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 57, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 271], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 55, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [488, 175, 504, 326], \\'text\\': \\'task html\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 179, 523, 369], \\'text\\': \\'2.23 kB 17:15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 70, 942, 182], \\'text\\': \\'Chrome\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 287, 942, 469], \\'text\\': \\'HTML Viewer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 577, 942, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Markor\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 547, 205, 779]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 796, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 57, 205, 297]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 314, 205, 532]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [859, 57, 945, 192]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [858, 556, 947, 694]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [859, 308, 945, 446]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [225, 828, 271, 939]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 54, 145, 234]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [282, 58, 540, 489]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 820, 36, 900]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 197, 35, 240]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

Then click the button 5 times, remember the numbers displayed, and enter their product in the form.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 74: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the File Manager app can be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Files\\' app icon at `[736,170]` was successful. The \\'Files\\' app opened, and the screen now displays the \\'Downloads\\' folder content. The file \\'task.html\\' is visible on the screen. This action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal (\\'Open File Manager App\\').\\n Step 75: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon, which has an associated icon bounding box `[685, 75, 788, 266]` and text \\'Files\\' at `[765, 124, 782, 205]`. This action is expected to open the \\'Files\\' app, which is the file manager. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'task.html\\' at [496, 250] did not result in any change on the screen. The file \\'task.html\\' did not open, and no \\'Open with\\' prompt appeared. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 76: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'task.html\\' file, which has text \\'task html\\' and bounding box `[488, 175, 504, 326]`. This action is expected to open the file, likely prompting to choose an application to open it with. Actual Outcome: The long press on \\'task.html\\' at `[410, 278]` successfully selected the file. This is evident from the blue highlight around \\'task.html\\', the checkmark next to it, the \\'1 selected\\' text appearing at the top of the screen, and the appearance of new action icons (share, delete). While this action didn\\'t directly open the file or show an \\'Open with\\' prompt, it brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling further interactions related to the selected file. The next step is to find the \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\' option, likely within a menu accessible via the \\'more options\\' icon.\\n Step 77: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[410,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'task.html\\' file item, which is located around `[410, 278]`. This action is expected to select the file and/or open a context menu with options like \\'Open\\', \\'Open with\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. The goal is to find an option to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'more options\\' icon at `[80, 900]` was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen, displaying several options for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). The options include \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Open with\\' option is now accessible.\\n Step 78: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located at approximately `[80, 900]` (bounding box `[66, 855, 94, 945]`). This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, hopefully including \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at `[134, 630]` was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, prompting the user to choose an application to open \\'task.html\\'. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully triggering the \\'Open with\\' prompt, which completes Subgoal 2.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 80: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and its associated icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file using the Chrome browser. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open File Manager App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app (e.g., \\'Files\\') is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon, which has an associated icon bounding box `[685, 75, 788, 266]` and text \\'Files\\' at `[765, 124, 782, 205]`. This action is expected to open the \\'Files\\' app, which is the file manager. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'task.html\\' at [496, 250] did not result in any change on the screen. The file \\'task.html\\' did not open, and no \\'Open with\\' prompt appeared. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 76: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'task.html\\' file, which has text \\'task html\\' and bounding box `[488, 175, 504, 326]`. This action is expected to open the file, likely prompting to choose an application to open it with. Actual Outcome: The long press on \\'task.html\\' at `[410, 278]` successfully selected the file. This is evident from the blue highlight around \\'task.html\\', the checkmark next to it, the \\'1 selected\\' text appearing at the top of the screen, and the appearance of new action icons (share, delete). While this action didn\\'t directly open the file or show an \\'Open with\\' prompt, it brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling further interactions related to the selected file. The next step is to find the \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\' option, likely within a menu accessible via the \\'more options\\' icon.\\n Step 77: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[410,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'task.html\\' file item, which is located around `[410, 278]`. This action is expected to select the file and/or open a context menu with options like \\'Open\\', \\'Open with\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. The goal is to find an option to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'more options\\' icon at `[80, 900]` was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen, displaying several options for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). The options include \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Open with\\' option is now accessible.\\n Step 78: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located at approximately `[80, 900]` (bounding box `[66, 855, 94, 945]`). This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, hopefully including \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at `[134, 630]` was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, prompting the user to choose an application to open \\'task.html\\'. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully triggering the \\'Open with\\' prompt, which completes Subgoal 2.\\n Step 79: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is located at bounding box `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. This action is expected to open a dialog or a list of applications that can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at `[902,124]` in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. Chrome launched and is now displaying a \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen. This screen requires accepting the terms and conditions before proceeding. The file \\'task.html\\' is not yet open. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully launching Chrome.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'17.20\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [494, 256, 519, 750], \\'text\\': \\'Welcome to Chrome\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [559, 55, 627, 825], \\'text\\': \\'By using Chrome; you agree to the Google Terms of Service; and the Google Chrome and ChromeOS Additional Terms of Service.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [649, 159, 697, 835], \\'text\\': \\'Help make Chrome better by sending usage statistics and crash reports to Google.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 355, 933, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Accept & continue\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 297, 944, 702]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 818, 36, 897]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [53, 420, 67, 508]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [52, 852, 67, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [329, 364, 453, 634]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 38, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [53, 567, 67, 648]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 906, 36, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [557, 581, 578, 801]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [52, 708, 67, 804]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then click the button 5 times, remember the numbers displayed, and enter their product in the form.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 75: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[736,170],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Files\\' app icon, which has an associated icon bounding box `[685, 75, 788, 266]` and text \\'Files\\' at `[765, 124, 782, 205]`. This action is expected to open the \\'Files\\' app, which is the file manager. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'task.html\\' at [496, 250] did not result in any change on the screen. The file \\'task.html\\' did not open, and no \\'Open with\\' prompt appeared. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 76: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'task.html\\' file, which has text \\'task html\\' and bounding box `[488, 175, 504, 326]`. This action is expected to open the file, likely prompting to choose an application to open it with. Actual Outcome: The long press on \\'task.html\\' at `[410, 278]` successfully selected the file. This is evident from the blue highlight around \\'task.html\\', the checkmark next to it, the \\'1 selected\\' text appearing at the top of the screen, and the appearance of new action icons (share, delete). While this action didn\\'t directly open the file or show an \\'Open with\\' prompt, it brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling further interactions related to the selected file. The next step is to find the \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\' option, likely within a menu accessible via the \\'more options\\' icon.\\n Step 77: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[410,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'task.html\\' file item, which is located around `[410, 278]`. This action is expected to select the file and/or open a context menu with options like \\'Open\\', \\'Open with\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. The goal is to find an option to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'more options\\' icon at `[80, 900]` was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen, displaying several options for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). The options include \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Open with\\' option is now accessible.\\n Step 78: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located at approximately `[80, 900]` (bounding box `[66, 855, 94, 945]`). This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, hopefully including \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at `[134, 630]` was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, prompting the user to choose an application to open \\'task.html\\'. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully triggering the \\'Open with\\' prompt, which completes Subgoal 2.\\n Step 79: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is located at bounding box `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. This action is expected to open a dialog or a list of applications that can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at `[902,124]` in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. Chrome launched and is now displaying a \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen. This screen requires accepting the terms and conditions before proceeding. The file \\'task.html\\' is not yet open. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully launching Chrome.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 81: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[921,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen with text \\'Accept & continue\\' and bounding box `[913, 355, 933, 646]`. This action is expected to accept the terms and continue, which should then load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open File Manager App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app (e.g., \\'Files\\') is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'task.html\\' file, which has text \\'task html\\' and bounding box `[488, 175, 504, 326]`. This action is expected to open the file, likely prompting to choose an application to open it with. Actual Outcome: The long press on \\'task.html\\' at `[410, 278]` successfully selected the file. This is evident from the blue highlight around \\'task.html\\', the checkmark next to it, the \\'1 selected\\' text appearing at the top of the screen, and the appearance of new action icons (share, delete). While this action didn\\'t directly open the file or show an \\'Open with\\' prompt, it brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling further interactions related to the selected file. The next step is to find the \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\' option, likely within a menu accessible via the \\'more options\\' icon.\\n Step 77: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[410,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'task.html\\' file item, which is located around `[410, 278]`. This action is expected to select the file and/or open a context menu with options like \\'Open\\', \\'Open with\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. The goal is to find an option to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'more options\\' icon at `[80, 900]` was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen, displaying several options for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). The options include \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Open with\\' option is now accessible.\\n Step 78: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located at approximately `[80, 900]` (bounding box `[66, 855, 94, 945]`). This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, hopefully including \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at `[134, 630]` was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, prompting the user to choose an application to open \\'task.html\\'. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully triggering the \\'Open with\\' prompt, which completes Subgoal 2.\\n Step 79: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is located at bounding box `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. This action is expected to open a dialog or a list of applications that can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at `[902,124]` in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. Chrome launched and is now displaying a \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen. This screen requires accepting the terms and conditions before proceeding. The file \\'task.html\\' is not yet open. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully launching Chrome.\\n Step 80: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and its associated icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file using the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Accept & continue\\' at `[921, 500]` on the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen was successful. Chrome has progressed to the next step in its initial setup, which is a screen asking \\'Turn on sync?\\'. This screen presents two options: \\'No thanks\\' and \\'Add account\\'. The file \\'task.html\\' is not yet open. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by moving through the Chrome setup process.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 132], \\'text\\': \\'17.21\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [222, 36, 252, 381], \\'text\\': \\'Turn on sync?\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [270, 34, 332, 964], \\'text\\': \\'Sync your passwords, history & more on all devices Google may use your history to personalize Search and other Google services\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [368, 38, 390, 767], \\'text\\': \\'You can always choose what to sync in settings.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [922, 64, 937, 230], \\'text\\': \\'No thanks\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [921, 698, 937, 908], \\'text\\': \\'Add account\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [908, 638, 953, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [103, 329, 169, 535]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 819, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 139, 35, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 36, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 907, 36, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [80, 679, 169, 775]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[496,250],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'task.html\\' file, which has text \\'task html\\' and bounding box `[488, 175, 504, 326]`. This action is expected to open the file, likely prompting to choose an application to open it with. Actual Outcome: The long press on \\'task.html\\' at `[410, 278]` successfully selected the file. This is evident from the blue highlight around \\'task.html\\', the checkmark next to it, the \\'1 selected\\' text appearing at the top of the screen, and the appearance of new action icons (share, delete). While this action didn\\'t directly open the file or show an \\'Open with\\' prompt, it brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling further interactions related to the selected file. The next step is to find the \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\' option, likely within a menu accessible via the \\'more options\\' icon.\\n Step 77: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[410,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'task.html\\' file item, which is located around `[410, 278]`. This action is expected to select the file and/or open a context menu with options like \\'Open\\', \\'Open with\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. The goal is to find an option to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'more options\\' icon at `[80, 900]` was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen, displaying several options for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). The options include \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Open with\\' option is now accessible.\\n Step 78: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located at approximately `[80, 900]` (bounding box `[66, 855, 94, 945]`). This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, hopefully including \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at `[134, 630]` was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, prompting the user to choose an application to open \\'task.html\\'. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully triggering the \\'Open with\\' prompt, which completes Subgoal 2.\\n Step 79: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is located at bounding box `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. This action is expected to open a dialog or a list of applications that can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at `[902,124]` in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. Chrome launched and is now displaying a \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen. This screen requires accepting the terms and conditions before proceeding. The file \\'task.html\\' is not yet open. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully launching Chrome.\\n Step 80: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and its associated icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file using the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Accept & continue\\' at `[921, 500]` on the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen was successful. Chrome has progressed to the next step in its initial setup, which is a screen asking \\'Turn on sync?\\'. This screen presents two options: \\'No thanks\\' and \\'Add account\\'. The file \\'task.html\\' is not yet open. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by moving through the Chrome setup process.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 82: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 132], \\'text\\': \\'17.21\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [222, 36, 252, 381], \\'text\\': \\'Turn on sync?\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [270, 34, 332, 964], \\'text\\': \\'Sync your passwords, history & more on all devices Google may use your history to personalize Search and other Google services\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [368, 38, 390, 767], \\'text\\': \\'You can always choose what to sync in settings.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [922, 64, 937, 230], \\'text\\': \\'No thanks\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [921, 698, 937, 908], \\'text\\': \\'Add account\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [908, 638, 953, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [103, 329, 169, 535]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 819, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 139, 36, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 36, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 907, 36, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [80, 680, 169, 775]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then click the button 5 times, remember the numbers displayed, and enter their product in the form.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 77: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[410,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the \\'task.html\\' file item, which is located around `[410, 278]`. This action is expected to select the file and/or open a context menu with options like \\'Open\\', \\'Open with\\', \\'Share\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. The goal is to find an option to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'more options\\' icon at `[80, 900]` was successful. A context menu appeared on the right side of the screen, displaying several options for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). The options include \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Open with\\' option is now accessible.\\n Step 78: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located at approximately `[80, 900]` (bounding box `[66, 855, 94, 945]`). This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, hopefully including \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at `[134, 630]` was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, prompting the user to choose an application to open \\'task.html\\'. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully triggering the \\'Open with\\' prompt, which completes Subgoal 2.\\n Step 79: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is located at bounding box `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. This action is expected to open a dialog or a list of applications that can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at `[902,124]` in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. Chrome launched and is now displaying a \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen. This screen requires accepting the terms and conditions before proceeding. The file \\'task.html\\' is not yet open. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully launching Chrome.\\n Step 80: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and its associated icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file using the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Accept & continue\\' at `[921, 500]` on the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen was successful. Chrome has progressed to the next step in its initial setup, which is a screen asking \\'Turn on sync?\\'. This screen presents two options: \\'No thanks\\' and \\'Add account\\'. The file \\'task.html\\' is not yet open. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by moving through the Chrome setup process.\\n Step 81: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[921,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen with text \\'Accept & continue\\' and bounding box `[913, 355, 933, 646]`. This action is expected to accept the terms and continue, which should then load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at `[930, 147]` on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen was unsuccessful.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, hopefully including \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at `[134, 630]` was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, prompting the user to choose an application to open \\'task.html\\'. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully triggering the \\'Open with\\' prompt, which completes Subgoal 2.\\n Step 79: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is located at bounding box `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. This action is expected to open a dialog or a list of applications that can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at `[902,124]` in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. Chrome launched and is now displaying a \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen. This screen requires accepting the terms and conditions before proceeding. The file \\'task.html\\' is not yet open. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully launching Chrome.\\n Step 80: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and its associated icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file using the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Accept & continue\\' at `[921, 500]` on the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen was successful. Chrome has progressed to the next step in its initial setup, which is a screen asking \\'Turn on sync?\\'. This screen presents two options: \\'No thanks\\' and \\'Add account\\'. The file \\'task.html\\' is not yet open. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by moving through the Chrome setup process.\\n Step 81: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[921,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen with text \\'Accept & continue\\' and bounding box `[913, 355, 933, 646]`. This action is expected to accept the terms and continue, which should then load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at `[930, 147]` on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen was unsuccessful. The screen did not change, and the \\'Turn on sync?\\' prompt is still visible. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening \\'task.html\\' in Chrome. The next step will be to retry tapping the \\'No thanks\\' button.\\n Step 82: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button, which has text \\'No thanks\\' and bounding box `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at `[930,147]` on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen in Chrome was performed. Instead of proceeding to load the \\'task.html\\' file, the Chrome application closed or navigated back, returning the view to the File Manager application. The File Manager is now showing the \\'Downloads\\' folder, and the \\'task.html\\' file is still selected (indicated by \\'1 selected\\' and a checkmark on the file). This action did not bring the agent closer to opening the file in Chrome; it was a setback. The process of opening the file with Chrome needs to be re-attempted from the File Manager.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 42, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'17.22\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 206, 91, 381], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0 selected\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 710, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'IPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [488, 175, 504, 326], \\'text\\': \\'task html\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 179, 523, 369], \\'text\\': \\'2.23 kB 17.15\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 546, 205, 781]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 313, 205, 533]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 795, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [476, 54, 535, 496]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 791, 94, 851]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 55, 145, 238]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 141, 37, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 855, 94, 945]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 40, 38, 137]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [232, 841, 259, 923]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [47, 116, 94, 393]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, hopefully including \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at `[134, 630]` was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, prompting the user to choose an application to open \\'task.html\\'. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully triggering the \\'Open with\\' prompt, which completes Subgoal 2.\\n Step 79: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is located at bounding box `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. This action is expected to open a dialog or a list of applications that can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at `[902,124]` in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. Chrome launched and is now displaying a \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen. This screen requires accepting the terms and conditions before proceeding. The file \\'task.html\\' is not yet open. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully launching Chrome.\\n Step 80: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and its associated icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file using the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Accept & continue\\' at `[921, 500]` on the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen was successful. Chrome has progressed to the next step in its initial setup, which is a screen asking \\'Turn on sync?\\'. This screen presents two options: \\'No thanks\\' and \\'Add account\\'. The file \\'task.html\\' is not yet open. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by moving through the Chrome setup process.\\n Step 81: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[921,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen with text \\'Accept & continue\\' and bounding box `[913, 355, 933, 646]`. This action is expected to accept the terms and continue, which should then load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at `[930, 147]` on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen was unsuccessful. The screen did not change, and the \\'Turn on sync?\\' prompt is still visible. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening \\'task.html\\' in Chrome. The next step will be to retry tapping the \\'No thanks\\' button.\\n Step 82: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button, which has text \\'No thanks\\' and bounding box `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at `[930,147]` on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen in Chrome was performed. Instead of proceeding to load the \\'task.html\\' file, the Chrome application closed or navigated back, returning the view to the File Manager application. The File Manager is now showing the \\'Downloads\\' folder, and the \\'task.html\\' file is still selected (indicated by \\'1 selected\\' and a checkmark on the file). This action did not bring the agent closer to opening the file in Chrome; it was a setback. The process of opening the file with Chrome needs to be re-attempted from the File Manager.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 84: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'Open with\\' text is located at bounding box `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. This action is expected to open a dialog or a list of applications that can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at `[902,124]` in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. Chrome launched and is now displaying a \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen. This screen requires accepting the terms and conditions before proceeding. The file \\'task.html\\' is not yet open. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by successfully launching Chrome.\\n Step 80: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and its associated icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file using the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Accept & continue\\' at `[921, 500]` on the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen was successful. Chrome has progressed to the next step in its initial setup, which is a screen asking \\'Turn on sync?\\'. This screen presents two options: \\'No thanks\\' and \\'Add account\\'. The file \\'task.html\\' is not yet open. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by moving through the Chrome setup process.\\n Step 81: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[921,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen with text \\'Accept & continue\\' and bounding box `[913, 355, 933, 646]`. This action is expected to accept the terms and continue, which should then load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at `[930, 147]` on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen was unsuccessful. The screen did not change, and the \\'Turn on sync?\\' prompt is still visible. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening \\'task.html\\' in Chrome. The next step will be to retry tapping the \\'No thanks\\' button.\\n Step 82: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button, which has text \\'No thanks\\' and bounding box `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at `[930,147]` on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen in Chrome was performed. Instead of proceeding to load the \\'task.html\\' file, the Chrome application closed or navigated back, returning the view to the File Manager application. The File Manager is now showing the \\'Downloads\\' folder, and the \\'task.html\\' file is still selected (indicated by \\'1 selected\\' and a checkmark on the file). This action did not bring the agent closer to opening the file in Chrome; it was a setback. The process of opening the file with Chrome needs to be re-attempted from the File Manager.\\n Step 83: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button, which is located at the bottom left of the screen with text \\'No thanks\\' and bounding box `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) at approximately `[80, 900]` was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, overlaying the File Manager. This menu contains several options for the selected file, including \\'Open with\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by successfully re-initiating the process to open the file.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 42, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'17.23\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 90, 381], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0 dY: 0.0 selected\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 710, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 549, 144, 712], \\'text\\': \\'Open with\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [176, 549, 196, 672], \\'text\\': \\'Sort by.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [229, 549, 246, 737], \\'text\\': \\'Deselect all\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [284, 637, 298, 678], \\'text\\': \\'to.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [335, 552, 351, 684], \\'text\\': \\'Move to.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [386, 547, 407, 716], \\'text\\': \\'Compress\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [440, 550, 455, 683], \\'text\\': \\'Rename\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [488, 175, 504, 326], \\'text\\': \\'task html\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [492, 551, 508, 678], \\'text\\': \\'Get info\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 179, 523, 369], \\'text\\': \\'2.23 kB 17.15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [280, 545, 302, 638], \\'text\\': \\'Copy\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [477, 51, 535, 492]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 855, 92, 972]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 314, 204, 520]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 193, 38, 244]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [108, 524, 157, 988]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 789, 93, 854]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [47, 117, 94, 394]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [160, 531, 213, 980]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and its associated icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file using the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Accept & continue\\' at `[921, 500]` on the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen was successful. Chrome has progressed to the next step in its initial setup, which is a screen asking \\'Turn on sync?\\'. This screen presents two options: \\'No thanks\\' and \\'Add account\\'. The file \\'task.html\\' is not yet open. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by moving through the Chrome setup process.\\n Step 81: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[921,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen with text \\'Accept & continue\\' and bounding box `[913, 355, 933, 646]`. This action is expected to accept the terms and continue, which should then load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at `[930, 147]` on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen was unsuccessful. The screen did not change, and the \\'Turn on sync?\\' prompt is still visible. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening \\'task.html\\' in Chrome. The next step will be to retry tapping the \\'No thanks\\' button.\\n Step 82: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button, which has text \\'No thanks\\' and bounding box `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at `[930,147]` on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen in Chrome was performed. Instead of proceeding to load the \\'task.html\\' file, the Chrome application closed or navigated back, returning the view to the File Manager application. The File Manager is now showing the \\'Downloads\\' folder, and the \\'task.html\\' file is still selected (indicated by \\'1 selected\\' and a checkmark on the file). This action did not bring the agent closer to opening the file in Chrome; it was a setback.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to accept the terms and continue, which should then load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at `[930, 147]` on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen was unsuccessful. The screen did not change, and the \\'Turn on sync?\\' prompt is still visible. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening \\'task.html\\' in Chrome. The next step will be to retry tapping the \\'No thanks\\' button.\\n Step 82: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button, which has text \\'No thanks\\' and bounding box `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at `[930,147]` on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen in Chrome was performed. Instead of proceeding to load the \\'task.html\\' file, the Chrome application closed or navigated back, returning the view to the File Manager application. The File Manager is now showing the \\'Downloads\\' folder, and the \\'task.html\\' file is still selected (indicated by \\'1 selected\\' and a checkmark on the file). This action did not bring the agent closer to opening the file in Chrome; it was a setback. The process of opening the file with Chrome needs to be re-attempted from the File Manager.\\n Step 83: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button, which is located at the bottom left of the screen with text \\'No thanks\\' and bounding box `[922, 64, 937, 230]`.

Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) at approximately `[80, 900]` was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, overlaying the File Manager. This menu contains several options for the selected file, including \\'Open with\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by successfully re-initiating the process to open the file.\\n Step 84: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, including \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at `[134,630]` was successful. An \\'Open with\\' dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, presenting \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\' as options to open the \\'task.html\\' file. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by successfully re-initiating the process to open the file with a specific application.\\n Step 85: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is located at bounding box `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. This action is expected to open a dialog or a list of applications that can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. The \\'task.html\\' file is now open and displayed in the Chrome browser. The page shows the number \\'9\\' and a \\'Click Me\\' button. This action has completed Subgoal 3 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The agent is now ready to interact with the webpage content as per Subgoal 4.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 43, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'17.24\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 148, 97, 755], \\'text\\': \\'6 content://com.android provider:\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [179, 452, 190, 551], \\'text\\': \\'Click Me\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 795, 107, 874]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [172, 428, 198, 574]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 116, 108, 203]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 897, 106, 968]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 141, 37, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [10, 815, 45, 947]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then click the button 5 times, remember the numbers displayed, and enter their product in the form.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 81: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[921,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button, which is located at the bottom of the screen with text \\'Accept & continue\\' and bounding box `[913, 355, 933, 646]`. This action is expected to accept the terms and continue, which should then load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at `[930, 147]` on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen was unsuccessful. The screen did not change, and the \\'Turn on sync?\\' prompt is still visible. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening \\'task.html\\' in Chrome. The next step will be to retry tapping the \\'No thanks\\' button.\\n Step 82: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button, which has text \\'No thanks\\' and bounding box `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at `[930,147]` on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen in Chrome was performed. Instead of proceeding to load the \\'task.html\\' file, the Chrome application closed or navigated back, returning the view to the File Manager application. The File Manager is now showing the \\'Downloads\\' folder, and the \\'task.html\\' file is still selected (indicated by \\'1 selected\\' and a checkmark on the file). This action did not bring the agent closer to opening the file in Chrome; it was a setback. The process of opening the file with Chrome needs to be re-attempted from the File Manager.\\n Step 83: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button, which is located at the bottom left of the screen with text \\'No thanks\\' and bounding box `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) at approximately `[80, 900]` was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, overlaying the File Manager. This menu contains several options for the selected file, including \\'Open with\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by successfully re-initiating the process to open the file.\\n Step 84: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located at approximately `[80, 900]` (bounding box `[66, 855, 94, 945]`). This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, including \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at `[134,630]` was successful. An \\'Open with\\' dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, presenting \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\' as options to open the \\'task.html\\' file. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by successfully re-initiating the process to open the file with a specific application.\\n Step 85: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is located at bounding box `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. This action is expected to open a dialog or a list of applications that can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. The \\'task.html\\' file is now open and displayed in the Chrome browser. The page shows the number \\'9\\' and a \\'Click Me\\' button. This action has completed Subgoal 3 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The agent is now ready to interact with the webpage content as per Subgoal 4.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 87: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. The number \\'9\\' is currently displayed; this will be recorded as \\'number_1\\'. Tapping the button is expected to change the displayed number.

Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input.

If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button, which has text \\'No thanks\\' and bounding box `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at `[930,147]` on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen in Chrome was performed. Instead of proceeding to load the \\'task.html\\' file, the Chrome application closed or navigated back, returning the view to the File Manager application. The File Manager is now showing the \\'Downloads\\' folder, and the \\'task.html\\' file is still selected (indicated by \\'1 selected\\' and a checkmark on the file). This action did not bring the agent closer to opening the file in Chrome; it was a setback. The process of opening the file with Chrome needs to be re-attempted from the File Manager.\\n Step 83: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button, which is located at the bottom left of the screen with text \\'No thanks\\' and bounding box `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) at approximately `[80, 900]` was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, overlaying the File Manager. This menu contains several options for the selected file, including \\'Open with\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by successfully re-initiating the process to open the file.\\n Step 84: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located at approximately `[80, 900]` (bounding box `[66, 855, 94, 945]`). This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, including \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at `[134,630]` was successful. An \\'Open with\\' dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, presenting \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\' as options to open the \\'task.html\\' file. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by successfully re-initiating the process to open the file with a specific application.\\n Step 85: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is located at bounding box `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. This action is expected to open a dialog or a list of applications that can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. The \\'task.html\\' file is now open and displayed in the Chrome browser. The page shows the number \\'9\\' and a \\'Click Me\\' button. This action has completed Subgoal 3 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The agent is now ready to interact with the webpage content as per Subgoal 4.\\n Step 86: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and its associated icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file using the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was successful. The number displayed on the webpage changed from \\'9\\' to \\'10\\'. This signifies the completion of the first of five required clicks. The number \\'10\\' has been identified as \\'number_1\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which involves clicking the button five times and recording the displayed numbers.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'17.25\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 148, 97, 755], \\'text\\': \\'6 content://com.android provider:\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [140, 473, 161, 535], \\'text\\': \\'10\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [179, 452, 190, 551], \\'text\\': \\'Click Me\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 795, 107, 873]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [172, 428, 198, 574]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 116, 108, 203]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 896, 106, 968]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 817, 42, 896]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 140, 37, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 902, 37, 947]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

Then click the button 5 times, remember the numbers displayed, and enter their product in the form.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 82: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button, which has text \\'No thanks\\' and bounding box `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at `[930,147]` on the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen in Chrome was performed. Instead of proceeding to load the \\'task.html\\' file, the Chrome application closed or navigated back, returning the view to the File Manager application. The File Manager is now showing the \\'Downloads\\' folder, and the \\'task.html\\' file is still selected (indicated by \\'1 selected\\' and a checkmark on the file). This action did not bring the agent closer to opening the file in Chrome; it was a setback. The process of opening the file with Chrome needs to be re-attempted from the File Manager.\\n Step 83: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button, which is located at the bottom left of the screen with text \\'No thanks\\' and bounding box `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) at approximately `[80, 900]` was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, overlaying the File Manager. This menu contains several options for the selected file, including \\'Open with\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by successfully re-initiating the process to open the file.\\n Step 84: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located at approximately `[80, 900]` (bounding box `[66, 855, 94, 945]`). This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, including \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at `[134,630]` was successful. An \\'Open with\\' dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, presenting \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\' as options to open the \\'task.html\\' file. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by successfully re-initiating the process to open the file with a specific application.\\n Step 85: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text is located at bounding box `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. This action is expected to open a dialog or a list of applications that can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. The \\'task.html\\' file is now open and displayed in the Chrome browser. The page shows the number \\'9\\' and a \\'Click Me\\' button. This action has completed Subgoal 3 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The agent is now ready to interact with the webpage content as per Subgoal 4.\\n Step 86: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and its associated icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file using the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was successful. The number displayed on the webpage changed from \\'9\\' to \\'10\\'. This signifies the completion of the first of five required clicks. The number \\'10\\' has been identified as \\'number_1\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which involves clicking the button five times and recording the displayed numbers.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 88: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. This is the second click. This action is expected to change the number displayed on the screen. The new number will be recorded as \\'number_2\\'.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) at approximately `[80, 900]` was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, overlaying the File Manager. This menu contains several options for the selected file, including \\'Open with\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by successfully re-initiating the process to open the file.\\n Step 84: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'more options\\' icon (three vertical dots) located at approximately `[80, 900]` (bounding box `[66, 855, 94, 945]`). This action is expected to open a context menu with options for the selected file, including \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at `[134,630]` was successful. An \\'Open with\\' dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, presenting \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\' as options to open the \\'task.html\\' file. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by successfully re-initiating the process to open the file with a specific application.\\n Step 85: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'17.27\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 148, 97, 755], \\'text\\': \\'6 content://com.android provider:\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [179, 452, 190, 551], \\'text\\': \\'Click Me\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 795, 107, 874]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [172, 428, 198, 574]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 116, 108, 203]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 897, 106, 968]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 139, 37, 188]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'17.28\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 148, 97, 755], \\'text\\': \\'6 content://com.android provider:\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [142, 489, 159, 514], \\'text\\': \\'5\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [179, 452, 190, 551], \\'text\\': \\'Click Me\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 795, 107, 874]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [172, 428, 198, 574]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 117, 108, 202]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 897, 106, 967]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 140, 37, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 816, 44, 897]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 902, 37, 947]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'Open with\\' text is located at bounding box `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. This action is expected to open a dialog or a list of applications that can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. The \\'task.html\\' file is now open and displayed in the Chrome browser. The page shows the number \\'9\\' and a \\'Click Me\\' button. This action has completed Subgoal 3 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The agent is now ready to interact with the webpage content as per Subgoal 4.\\n Step 86: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and its associated icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file using the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was successful. The number displayed on the webpage changed from \\'9\\' to \\'10\\'. This signifies the completion of the first of five required clicks. The number \\'10\\' has been identified as \\'number_1\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which involves clicking the button five times and recording the displayed numbers.\\n Step 87: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. The number \\'9\\' is currently displayed; this will be recorded as \\'number_1\\'. Tapping the button is expected to change the displayed number. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was successful. The number displayed on the webpage changed from \\'10\\' to \\'9\\'. This signifies the completion of the second of five required clicks. The number \\'9\\' has been identified and will be stored as \\'number_2\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 88: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. This is the second click. This action is expected to change the number displayed on the screen. The new number will be recorded as \\'number_2\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was successful. The number displayed on the webpage changed from \\'9\\' to \\'5\\'. This signifies the completion of the third of five required clicks. The number \\'5\\' has been identified and will be stored as \\'number_3\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 89: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The number \\'9\\' is currently displayed. Tapping the button is expected to change the displayed number. This will be the third click. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was performed. However, the number displayed on the webpage did not change from \\'5\\'. This means the number resulting from the fourth click is \\'5\\'. This number has been identified and will be stored as \\'number_4\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, as four out of five clicks have been performed and their corresponding numbers recorded.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'17.28\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 148, 97, 755], \\'text\\': \\'6 content://com.android provider:\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [142, 489, 159, 514], \\'text\\': \\'5\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [179, 452, 190, 551], \\'text\\': \\'Click Me\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 795, 107, 873]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [172, 428, 198, 574]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 116, 108, 202]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 897, 106, 967]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 140, 37, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 816, 45, 896]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 902, 37, 947]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'Open with\\' text is located at bounding box `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. This action is expected to open a dialog or a list of applications that can be used to open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. The \\'task.html\\' file is now open and displayed in the Chrome browser. The page shows the number \\'9\\' and a \\'Click Me\\' button. This action has completed Subgoal 3 and brought the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The agent is now ready to interact with the webpage content as per Subgoal 4.\\n Step 86: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and its associated icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file using the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was successful. The number displayed on the webpage changed from \\'9\\' to \\'10\\'. This signifies the completion of the first of five required clicks. The number \\'10\\' has been identified as \\'number_1\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which involves clicking the button five times and recording the displayed numbers.\\n Step 87: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. The number \\'9\\' is currently displayed; this will be recorded as \\'number_1\\'. Tapping the button is expected to change the displayed number. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was successful. The number displayed on the webpage changed from \\'10\\' to \\'9\\'. This signifies the completion of the second of five required clicks. The number \\'9\\' has been identified and will be stored as \\'number_2\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 88: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. This is the second click. This action is expected to change the number displayed on the screen. The new number will be recorded as \\'number_2\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was successful. The number displayed on the webpage changed from \\'9\\' to \\'5\\'. This signifies the completion of the third of five required clicks. The number \\'5\\' has been identified and will be stored as \\'number_3\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 89: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. The number \\'9\\' is currently displayed. Tapping the button is expected to change the displayed number. This will be the third click. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was performed. However, the number displayed on the webpage did not change from \\'5\\'. This means the number resulting from the fourth click is \\'5\\'. This number has been identified and will be stored as \\'number_4\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, as four out of five clicks have been performed and their corresponding numbers recorded.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 91: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard.

The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with text \\'Chrome\\' and its associated icon. This action is expected to open the \\'task.html\\' file using the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was successful. The number displayed on the webpage changed from \\'9\\' to \\'10\\'. This signifies the completion of the first of five required clicks. The number \\'10\\' has been identified as \\'number_1\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which involves clicking the button five times and recording the displayed numbers.\\n Step 87: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. The number \\'9\\' is currently displayed; this will be recorded as \\'number_1\\'. Tapping the button is expected to change the displayed number. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was successful. The number displayed on the webpage changed from \\'10\\' to \\'9\\'. This signifies the completion of the second of five required clicks. The number \\'9\\' has been identified and will be stored as \\'number_2\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 88: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. This is the second click. This action is expected to change the number displayed on the screen. The new number will be recorded as \\'number_2\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was successful. The number displayed on the webpage changed from \\'9\\' to \\'5\\'. This signifies the completion of the third of five required clicks. The number \\'5\\' has been identified and will be stored as \\'number_3\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 89: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The number \\'9\\' is currently displayed. Tapping the button is expected to change the displayed number. This will be the third click. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) was performed. However, the number displayed on the webpage did not change from \\'5\\'. This means the number resulting from the fourth click is \\'5\\'. This number has been identified and will be stored as \\'number_4\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, as four out of five clicks have been performed and their corresponding numbers recorded.\\n Step 90: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[185,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Click Me\\' button, which has text \\'Click Me\\' and bounding box `[172, 428, 198, 574]`. This is the fourth click. This action is expected to change the number displayed on the screen. The new number will be recorded as \\'number_4\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Click Me\\' button (at `[185,501]`) for the fifth time was successful. Before this click, the number \\'5\\' was displayed. After the click, the \\'Click Me\\' button and the number \\'5\\' disappeared. A new section of the webpage appeared, showing an input field with placeholder text \\'Enter the product\\' and a \\'Submit\\' button. This means the fifth number to be recorded is \\'5\\'. All five numbers have now been recorded (number_1=10, number_2=9, number_3=5, number_4=5, number_5=5). This action completes Subgoal 4 and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The agent is now ready to calculate the product of the numbers.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'17.29\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 148, 97, 755], \\'text\\': \\'6 content://com.android provider:\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [140, 328, 150, 475], \\'text\\': \\'Enter the product\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [140, 606, 150, 670], \\'text\\': \\'Submit\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 795, 106, 872]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [136, 593, 154, 680]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 140, 38, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 39, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 899, 105, 968]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [135, 319, 155, 595]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 818, 42, 897]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 115, 107, 202]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 42, 39, 135]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 904, 39, 946]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.
