Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"product_of_numbers = 11250\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Calculate the product of the five numbers (10 * 9 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 11250) and store it in memory as \\'product_of_numbers\\'. This action does not interact with the screen. The predicted outcome is that the \\'product_of_numbers\\' variable in memory will be updated to \\'11250\\', and the active subgoal will change to Subgoal 6: \\'Enter the product into the form\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the icon at `[922,863]` resulted in opening the Google Lens app, not the Camera app as intended. This means the tapped icon was for Google Lens. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 93: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[514,392],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the middle of the screen. The icon is a stylized camera. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) was successful. Google Lens, which was visible in the first screenshot, was closed, and the device returned to the home screen, as shown in the second screenshot. This action corrected the error from the previous step but did not directly progress towards opening the Camera app, other than returning to a state where another attempt can be made.\\n Step 94: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[922,863],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which has a bounding box of `[892, 801, 952, 925]`. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing numerous app icons. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 95: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close Google Lens and return to the previous screen (likely the home screen). This will allow me to attempt to open the Camera app again. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Camera app icon at [474,393] in the app drawer was successful. The Camera app launched, and the screen now displays the camera\\'s viewfinder and controls. This completes the subgoal of opening the Camera app and moves the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction to take a photo.\\n Step 96: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [400, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the Camera app icon can be located. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the shutter button at `[906, 500]` appears to have successfully taken a photo. The camera icon on the left side of the screen disappeared, which is consistent with a photo being taken. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and the overall user instruction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"product_of_numbers = 11250\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Calculate the product of the five numbers (10 * 9 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 11250) and store it in memory as \\'product_of_numbers\\'. This action does not interact with the screen. The predicted outcome is that the \\'product_of_numbers\\' variable in memory will be updated to \\'11250\\', and the active subgoal will change to Subgoal 6: \\'Enter the product into the form\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the icon at `[922,863]` resulted in opening the Google Lens app, not the Camera app as intended. This means the tapped icon was for Google Lens. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 93: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[514,392],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the middle of the screen. The icon is a stylized camera. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) was successful. Google Lens, which was visible in the first screenshot, was closed, and the device returned to the home screen, as shown in the second screenshot. This action corrected the error from the previous step but did not directly progress towards opening the Camera app, other than returning to a state where another attempt can be made.\\n Step 94: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[922,863],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which has a bounding box of `[892, 801, 952, 925]`. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing numerous app icons. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 95: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close Google Lens and return to the previous screen (likely the home screen). This will allow me to attempt to open the Camera app again. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Camera app icon at [474,393] in the app drawer was successful. The Camera app launched, and the screen now displays the camera\\'s viewfinder and controls. This completes the subgoal of opening the Camera app and moves the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction to take a photo.\\n Step 96: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [400, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the Camera app icon can be located. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the shutter button at `[906, 500]` appears to have successfully taken a photo. The camera icon on the left side of the screen disappeared, which is consistent with a photo being taken. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and the overall user instruction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 99: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,540],\"end_point\":[300,540],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 540] to [300, 540]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the Camera app icon can be located.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[514,392],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the middle of the screen. The icon is a stylized camera. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) was successful. Google Lens, which was visible in the first screenshot, was closed, and the device returned to the home screen, as shown in the second screenshot. This action corrected the error from the previous step but did not directly progress towards opening the Camera app, other than returning to a state where another attempt can be made.\\n Step 94: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[922,863],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which has a bounding box of `[892, 801, 952, 925]`. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing numerous app icons. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 95: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close Google Lens and return to the previous screen (likely the home screen). This will allow me to attempt to open the Camera app again. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Camera app icon at [474,393] in the app drawer was successful. The Camera app launched, and the screen now displays the camera\\'s viewfinder and controls. This completes the subgoal of opening the Camera app and moves the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction to take a photo.\\n Step 96: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [400, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the Camera app icon can be located. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the shutter button at `[906, 500]` appears to have successfully taken a photo. The camera icon on the left side of the screen disappeared, which is consistent with a photo being taken. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and the overall user instruction.\\n Step 97: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[474,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the app drawer. The icon is a stylized camera and is labeled \\'Camera\\'. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing numerous app icons. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.35\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'IdY:-1440.0 Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 679], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: -1.440\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 712, 65, 797], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 46, 147, 306], \\'text\\': \\'Sun; Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 336, 722, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Gmail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 561, 722, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [704, 781, 722, 921], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [783, 316, 855, 707], \\'text\\': \\'@ 0\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 72, 855, 232]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 765, 856, 929]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 302, 856, 464]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 540, 859, 702]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 764, 736, 928]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 538, 733, 696]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [901, 701, 947, 794]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 303, 728, 460]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [893, 802, 952, 924]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 822, 42, 897]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[514,392],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the middle of the screen. The icon is a stylized camera. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) was successful. Google Lens, which was visible in the first screenshot, was closed, and the device returned to the home screen, as shown in the second screenshot. This action corrected the error from the previous step but did not directly progress towards opening the Camera app, other than returning to a state where another attempt can be made.\\n Step 94: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[922,863],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which has a bounding box of `[892, 801, 952, 925]`. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing numerous app icons. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 95: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close Google Lens and return to the previous screen (likely the home screen). This will allow me to attempt to open the Camera app again. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Camera app icon at [474,393] in the app drawer was successful. The Camera app launched, and the screen now displays the camera\\'s viewfinder and controls. This completes the subgoal of opening the Camera app and moves the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction to take a photo.\\n Step 96: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [400, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the Camera app icon can be located. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the shutter button at `[906, 500]` appears to have successfully taken a photo. The camera icon on the left side of the screen disappeared, which is consistent with a photo being taken. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and the overall user instruction.\\n Step 97: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[474,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the app drawer. The icon is a stylized camera and is labeled \\'Camera\\'. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing numerous app icons. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 100: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (from `[900, 500]` to `[400, 500]`) to open the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the Camera app can be located. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Camera App and Set to Video Mode\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Camera app is open, and if it was not already in video mode, it has been switched to video mode.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"},{\"VariableName\":\"videoRecordingCompleted\",\"Content\":\"\",\"Status\":\"This piece of information is sought. No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[922,863],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which has a bounding box of `[892, 801, 952, 925]`. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing numerous app icons. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 95: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close Google Lens and return to the previous screen (likely the home screen). This will allow me to attempt to open the Camera app again. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Camera app icon at [474,393] in the app drawer was successful. The Camera app launched, and the screen now displays the camera\\'s viewfinder and controls. This completes the subgoal of opening the Camera app and moves the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction to take a photo.\\n Step 96: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [400, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the Camera app icon can be located. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the shutter button at `[906, 500]` appears to have successfully taken a photo. The camera icon on the left side of the screen disappeared, which is consistent with a photo being taken. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and the overall user instruction.\\n Step 97: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[474,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the app drawer. The icon is a stylized camera and is labeled \\'Camera\\'. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing numerous app icons. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 98: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[906,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the shutter button, which is a large camera icon at the bottom center of the screen with bounding box `[886, 449, 926, 552]`. This action is expected to take a photo. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing numerous app icons. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing numerous app icons. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 95: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close Google Lens and return to the previous screen (likely the home screen). This will allow me to attempt to open the Camera app again. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Camera app icon at [474,393] in the app drawer was successful. The Camera app launched, and the screen now displays the camera\\'s viewfinder and controls. This completes the subgoal of opening the Camera app and moves the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction to take a photo.\\n Step 96: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [400, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the Camera app icon can be located. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the shutter button at `[906, 500]` appears to have successfully taken a photo. The camera icon on the left side of the screen disappeared, which is consistent with a photo being taken. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and the overall user instruction.\\n Step 97: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The icon is a stylized camera and is labeled \\'Camera\\'. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing numerous app icons. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 98: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"},{\"VariableName\":\"videoRecordingCompleted\",\"Content\":\"\",\"Status\":\"This piece of information is sought. No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 811, 39, 953]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [985, 363, 1000, 633]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the Camera app icon can be located. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the shutter button at `[906, 500]` appears to have successfully taken a photo. The camera icon on the left side of the screen disappeared, which is consistent with a photo being taken. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and the overall user instruction.\\n Step 97: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[474,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the app drawer. The icon is a stylized camera and is labeled \\'Camera\\'. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing numerous app icons. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 98: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[906,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the shutter button, which is a large camera icon at the bottom center of the screen with bounding box `[886, 449, 926, 552]`. This action is expected to take a photo. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing numerous app icons. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 99: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,540],\"end_point\":[300,540],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 540] to [300, 540]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the Camera app icon can be located. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Camera app icon at [474, 392] was successful. The Camera app launched, and the screen now displays the camera\\'s viewfinder and controls. Specifically, a large camera icon (shutter button) is in the center, and a green video camera icon is in the top right. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app and setting it to video mode.\\n Step 100: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (from `[900, 500]` to `[400, 500]`) to open the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the Camera app can be located. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the green video camera icon at [26, 882] did not switch the camera to video mode as expected. Instead, it opened an image viewer or gallery, displaying a rendered image of a room. This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the agent needs to return to the camera interface and find the correct way to switch to video mode.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Jxv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [886, 449, 927, 552]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the Camera app icon can be located. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the shutter button at `[906, 500]` appears to have successfully taken a photo. The camera icon on the left side of the screen disappeared, which is consistent with a photo being taken. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal and the overall user instruction.\\n Step 97: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[474,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the app drawer. The icon is a stylized camera and is labeled \\'Camera\\'. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing numerous app icons. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 98: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[906,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the shutter button, which is a large camera icon at the bottom center of the screen with bounding box `[886, 449, 926, 552]`. This action is expected to take a photo. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing numerous app icons. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 99: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,540],\"end_point\":[300,540],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 540] to [300, 540]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the Camera app icon can be located. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Camera app icon at [474, 392] was successful. The Camera app launched, and the screen now displays the camera\\'s viewfinder and controls. Specifically, a large camera icon (shutter button) is in the center, and a green video camera icon is in the top right. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app and setting it to video mode.\\n Step 100: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (from `[900, 500]` to `[400, 500]`) to open the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the Camera app can be located. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the green video camera icon at [26, 882] did not switch the camera to video mode as expected. Instead, it opened an image viewer or gallery, displaying a rendered image of a room. This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the agent needs to return to the camera interface and find the correct way to switch to video mode.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 103: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to return from the image viewer to the camera interface.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The Camera app launched, and the screen now displays the camera\\'s viewfinder and controls. Specifically, a large camera icon (shutter button) is in the center, and a green video camera icon is in the top right. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app and setting it to video mode.\\n Step 100: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (from `[900, 500]` to `[400, 500]`) to open the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the Camera app can be located. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the green video camera icon at [26, 882] did not switch the camera to video mode as expected. Instead, it opened an image viewer or gallery, displaying a rendered image of a room. This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the agent needs to return to the camera interface and find the correct way to switch to video mode.\\n Step 101: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[474,392],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is labeled \"Camera\" and has a bounding box of `[423, 295, 526, 489]`. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (`KEYCODE_BACK`) did not return to the camera interface as expected. Instead, it navigated from the image viewer (first screenshot) to the app drawer (second screenshot). This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal because the camera app is no longer open. To correct this, the agent needs to reopen the Camera app from the app drawer and then find the correct control to switch to video mode.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[474,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the app drawer. The icon is a stylized camera and is labeled \\'Camera\\'. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing numerous app icons. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 98: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[906,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the shutter button, which is a large camera icon at the bottom center of the screen with bounding box `[886, 449, 926, 552]`. This action is expected to take a photo. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing numerous app icons. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 99: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,540],\"end_point\":[300,540],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 540] to [300, 540]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the Camera app icon can be located. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Camera app icon at [474, 392] was successful. The Camera app launched, and the screen now displays the camera\\'s viewfinder and controls. Specifically, a large camera icon (shutter button) is in the center, and a green video camera icon is in the top right. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app and setting it to video mode.\\n Step 100: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (from `[900, 500]` to `[400, 500]`) to open the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the Camera app can be located. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the green video camera icon at [26, 882] did not switch the camera to video mode as expected. Instead, it opened an image viewer or gallery, displaying a rendered image of a room. This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the agent needs to return to the camera interface and find the correct way to switch to video mode.\\n Step 101: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[474,392],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is labeled \"Camera\" and has a bounding box of `[423, 295, 526, 489]`. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (`KEYCODE_BACK`) did not return to the camera interface as expected. Instead, it navigated from the image viewer (first screenshot) to the app drawer (second screenshot). This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal because the camera app is no longer open. To correct this, the agent needs to reopen the Camera app from the app drawer and then find the correct control to switch to video mode.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 104: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[474,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"},{\"VariableName\":\"videoRecordingCompleted\",\"Content\":\"\",\"Status\":\"This piece of information is sought. No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app and setting it to video mode.\\n Step 100: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (from `[900, 500]` to `[400, 500]`) to open the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the Camera app can be located. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the green video camera icon at [26, 882] did not switch the camera to video mode as expected. Instead, it opened an image viewer or gallery, displaying a rendered image of a room. This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the agent needs to return to the camera interface and find the correct way to switch to video mode.\\n Step 101: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[474,392],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is labeled \"Camera\" and has a bounding box of `[423, 295, 526, 489]`. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (`KEYCODE_BACK`) did not return to the camera interface as expected. Instead, it navigated from the image viewer (first screenshot) to the app drawer (second screenshot). This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal because the camera app is no longer open. To correct this, the agent needs to reopen the Camera app from the app drawer and then find the correct control to switch to video mode.\\n Step 102: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[26,882],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the green video camera icon in the top right corner (center at approximately [26, 882]) to switch the camera to video mode. This icon is currently visible and tappable. This action is expected to change the camera interface to video recording mode, likely changing the central shutter button to a record button. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Camera app icon at [474, 393] was successful. The Camera app launched, and the screen now displays the camera\\'s viewfinder and controls. Specifically, a large camera icon (shutter button) is at the bottom center, and a video camera icon is in the top right. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app and setting it to video mode.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Jxv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 811, 39, 953]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [886, 449, 927, 552]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to take a photo. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to the app drawer, revealing numerous app icons. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app.\\n Step 99: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,540],\"end_point\":[300,540],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 540] to [300, 540]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the Camera app icon can be located. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Camera app icon at [474, 392] was successful. The Camera app launched, and the screen now displays the camera\\'s viewfinder and controls. Specifically, a large camera icon (shutter button) is in the center, and a green video camera icon is in the top right.

If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the Camera app icon can be located. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Camera app icon at [474, 392] was successful. The Camera app launched, and the screen now displays the camera\\'s viewfinder and controls. Specifically, a large camera icon (shutter button) is in the center, and a green video camera icon is in the top right. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app and setting it to video mode.\\n Step 100: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (from `[900, 500]` to `[400, 500]`) to open the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the Camera app can be located. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the green video camera icon at [26, 882] did not switch the camera to video mode as expected. Instead, it opened an image viewer or gallery, displaying a rendered image of a room. This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the agent needs to return to the camera interface and find the correct way to switch to video mode.\\n Step 101: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[474,392],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is labeled \"Camera\" and has a bounding box of `[423, 295, 526, 489]`. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (`KEYCODE_BACK`) did not return to the camera interface as expected. Instead, it navigated from the image viewer (first screenshot) to the app drawer (second screenshot). This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal because the camera app is no longer open. To correct this, the agent needs to reopen the Camera app from the app drawer and then find the correct control to switch to video mode.\\n Step 102: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[26,882],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the green video camera icon in the top right corner (center at approximately [26, 882]) to switch the camera to video mode. This icon is currently visible and tappable. This action is expected to change the camera interface to video recording mode, likely changing the central shutter button to a record button. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Camera app icon at [474, 393] was successful. The Camera app launched, and the screen now displays the camera\\'s viewfinder and controls. Specifically, a large camera icon (shutter button) is at the bottom center, and a video camera icon is in the top right. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app and setting it to video mode.\\n Step 103: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to return from the image viewer to the camera interface. This action is expected to close the current image viewer and display the camera interface again. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots icon at [799, 916] was successful. It revealed three new icons above the shutter button: a flash icon, a grid icon, and a phone orientation icon. These are likely camera settings or options. This action did not directly switch the camera to video mode, but it provided more information about the available controls. The agent is still in the camera app, and the goal is to switch to video mode.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Jxv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [785, 327, 821, 599], \\'text\\': \\'4   4\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [886, 449, 927, 552]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [787, 313, 823, 397]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [787, 453, 825, 547]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 253], \\'text\\': \\'1e 43 20\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 537], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: -0.432\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [786, 327, 821, 595], \\'text\\': \\'@   A\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [897, 472, 922, 526], \\'text\\': \\'0\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [786, 455, 824, 543]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [787, 314, 823, 395]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nTake one video.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 99: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,540],\"end_point\":[300,540],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 540] to [300, 540]) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where the Camera app icon can be located. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Camera app icon at [474, 392] was successful. The Camera app launched, and the screen now displays the camera\\'s viewfinder and controls. Specifically, a large camera icon (shutter button) is in the center, and a green video camera icon is in the top right. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app and setting it to video mode.\\n Step 100: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen (from `[900, 500]` to `[400, 500]`) to open the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the Camera app can be located. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the green video camera icon at [26, 882] did not switch the camera to video mode as expected. Instead, it opened an image viewer or gallery, displaying a rendered image of a room. This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the agent needs to return to the camera interface and find the correct way to switch to video mode.\\n Step 101: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[474,392],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is labeled \"Camera\" and has a bounding box of `[423, 295, 526, 489]`. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (`KEYCODE_BACK`) did not return to the camera interface as expected. Instead, it navigated from the image viewer (first screenshot) to the app drawer (second screenshot). This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal because the camera app is no longer open. To correct this, the agent needs to reopen the Camera app from the app drawer and then find the correct control to switch to video mode.\\n Step 102: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[26,882],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the green video camera icon in the top right corner (center at approximately [26, 882]) to switch the camera to video mode. This icon is currently visible and tappable. This action is expected to change the camera interface to video recording mode, likely changing the central shutter button to a record button. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Camera app icon at [474, 393] was successful. The Camera app launched, and the screen now displays the camera\\'s viewfinder and controls. Specifically, a large camera icon (shutter button) is at the bottom center, and a video camera icon is in the top right. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app and setting it to video mode.\\n Step 103: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to return from the image viewer to the camera interface. This action is expected to close the current image viewer and display the camera interface again. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots icon at [799, 916] was successful. It revealed three new icons above the shutter button: a flash icon, a grid icon, and a phone orientation icon. These are likely camera settings or options. This action did not directly switch the camera to video mode, but it provided more information about the available controls. The agent is still in the camera app, and the goal is to switch to video mode.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 106: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,700],\"end_point\":[900,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from right to left (from [900, 700] to [900, 300]) across the lower part of the screen, near the shutter button. This action is an attempt to switch the camera mode from photo to video, as this is a common gesture in many camera applications. The current camera mode is photo, indicated by the camera shutter icon. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Camera App and Set to Video Mode\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Camera app is open, and if it was not already in video mode, it has been switched to video mode.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the Camera app can be located. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the green video camera icon at [26, 882] did not switch the camera to video mode as expected. Instead, it opened an image viewer or gallery, displaying a rendered image of a room. This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the agent needs to return to the camera interface and find the correct way to switch to video mode.\\n Step 101: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[474,392],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is labeled \"Camera\" and has a bounding box of `[423, 295, 526, 489]`. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (`KEYCODE_BACK`) did not return to the camera interface as expected. Instead, it navigated from the image viewer (first screenshot) to the app drawer (second screenshot). This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal because the camera app is no longer open. To correct this, the agent needs to reopen the Camera app from the app drawer and then find the correct control to switch to video mode.\\n Step 102: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[26,882],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the green video camera icon in the top right corner (center at approximately [26, 882]) to switch the camera to video mode. This icon is currently visible and tappable. This action is expected to change the camera interface to video recording mode, likely changing the central shutter button to a record button. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Camera app icon at [474, 393] was successful. The Camera app launched, and the screen now displays the camera\\'s viewfinder and controls. Specifically, a large camera icon (shutter button) is at the bottom center, and a video camera icon is in the top right. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app and setting it to video mode.\\n Step 103: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to return from the image viewer to the camera interface. This action is expected to close the current image viewer and display the camera interface again. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots icon at [799, 916] was successful. It revealed three new icons above the shutter button: a flash icon, a grid icon, and a phone orientation icon. These are likely camera settings or options. This action did not directly switch the camera to video mode, but it provided more information about the available controls. The agent is still in the camera app, and the goal is to switch to video mode.\\n Step 104: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[474,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the app drawer. The icon is a stylized camera and is labeled \\'Camera\\'. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe from right to left (from [900, 700] to [900, 300]) did not switch the camera to video mode. The shutter button is still a camera icon. The three icons (flash, grid, phone orientation) that were previously visible above the shutter button are now gone. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the camera to video mode. The next step is to try swiping in the opposite direction (left to right).\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 107: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,250],\"end_point\":[900,750],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from left to right across the screen, near the shutter button area (from `[900, 250]` to `[900, 750]`). This action is an attempt to switch the camera to video mode. The camera is currently in photo mode, as indicated by the camera shutter icon.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[474,392],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is labeled \"Camera\" and has a bounding box of `[423, 295, 526, 489]`. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (`KEYCODE_BACK`) did not return to the camera interface as expected. Instead, it navigated from the image viewer (first screenshot) to the app drawer (second screenshot). This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal because the camera app is no longer open. To correct this, the agent needs to reopen the Camera app from the app drawer and then find the correct control to switch to video mode.\\n Step 102: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[26,882],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the green video camera icon in the top right corner (center at approximately [26, 882]) to switch the camera to video mode. This icon is currently visible and tappable. This action is expected to change the camera interface to video recording mode, likely changing the central shutter button to a record button. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Camera app icon at [474, 393] was successful. The Camera app launched, and the screen now displays the camera\\'s viewfinder and controls. Specifically, a large camera icon (shutter button) is at the bottom center, and a video camera icon is in the top right. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app and setting it to video mode.\\n Step 103: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to return from the image viewer to the camera interface. This action is expected to close the current image viewer and display the camera interface again. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots icon at [799, 916] was successful. It revealed three new icons above the shutter button: a flash icon, a grid icon, and a phone orientation icon. These are likely camera settings or options. This action did not directly switch the camera to video mode, but it provided more information about the available controls. The agent is still in the camera app, and the goal is to switch to video mode.\\n Step 104: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[474,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the app drawer. The icon is a stylized camera and is labeled \\'Camera\\'. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe from right to left (from [900, 700] to [900, 300]) did not switch the camera to video mode. The shutter button is still a camera icon. The three icons (flash, grid, phone orientation) that were previously visible above the shutter button are now gone. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the camera to video mode. The next step is to try swiping in the opposite direction (left to right).\\n Step 105: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[799,916],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots icon located at approximately [799, 916] (center of bounding box [780, 880, 819, 953]). This action is expected to open a menu or reveal additional camera options, potentially including a way to switch to video mode. Actual Outcome: The swipe from left to right (from `[900, 250]` to `[900, 750]`) successfully revealed the camera mode selection options. The screen now displays \"Camera\" and \"Video\" options. \"Camera\" is currently selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the camera to video mode. The next step is to tap on the \"Video\" option.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 250], \\'text\\': \\'Lae 54020\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Jxv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [498, 211, 515, 354], \\'text\\': \\'Camera\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [572, 211, 589, 319], \\'text\\': \\'Video\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [673, 605, 748, 904], \\'text\\': \\'In Settings, change resolution and quality; or try advanced features.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [787, 324, 821, 547], \\'text\\': \\'&   A\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [660, 579, 762, 972]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [549, 28, 612, 481]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [475, 27, 540, 446]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [785, 450, 828, 551]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This icon is currently visible and tappable. This action is expected to change the camera interface to video recording mode, likely changing the central shutter button to a record button. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Camera app icon at [474, 393] was successful. The Camera app launched, and the screen now displays the camera\\'s viewfinder and controls. Specifically, a large camera icon (shutter button) is at the bottom center, and a video camera icon is in the top right. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app and setting it to video mode.\\n Step 103: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to return from the image viewer to the camera interface. This action is expected to close the current image viewer and display the camera interface again. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots icon at [799, 916] was successful. It revealed three new icons above the shutter button: a flash icon, a grid icon, and a phone orientation icon. These are likely camera settings or options. This action did not directly switch the camera to video mode, but it provided more information about the available controls. The agent is still in the camera app, and the goal is to switch to video mode.\\n Step 104: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[474,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the app drawer. The icon is a stylized camera and is labeled \\'Camera\\'. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe from right to left (from [900, 700] to [900, 300]) did not switch the camera to video mode. The shutter button is still a camera icon. The three icons (flash, grid, phone orientation) that were previously visible above the shutter button are now gone. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the camera to video mode. The next step is to try swiping in the opposite direction (left to right).\\n Step 105: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[799,916],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots icon located at approximately [799, 916] (center of bounding box [780, 880, 819, 953]). This action is expected to open a menu or reveal additional camera options, potentially including a way to switch to video mode. Actual Outcome: The swipe from left to right (from `[900, 250]` to `[900, 750]`) successfully revealed the camera mode selection options. The screen now displays \"Camera\" and \"Video\" options. \"Camera\" is currently selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the camera to video mode. The next step is to tap on the \"Video\" option.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 108: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This icon is currently visible and tappable. This action is expected to change the camera interface to video recording mode, likely changing the central shutter button to a record button. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Camera app icon at [474, 393] was successful. The Camera app launched, and the screen now displays the camera\\'s viewfinder and controls. Specifically, a large camera icon (shutter button) is at the bottom center, and a video camera icon is in the top right. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app and setting it to video mode.\\n Step 103: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to return from the image viewer to the camera interface. This action is expected to close the current image viewer and display the camera interface again. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots icon at [799, 916] was successful. It revealed three new icons above the shutter button: a flash icon, a grid icon, and a phone orientation icon. These are likely camera settings or options. This action did not directly switch the camera to video mode, but it provided more information about the available controls. The agent is still in the camera app, and the goal is to switch to video mode.\\n Step 104: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[474,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the app drawer. The icon is a stylized camera and is labeled \\'Camera\\'. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe from right to left (from [900, 700] to [900, 300]) did not switch the camera to video mode. The shutter button is still a camera icon. The three icons (flash, grid, phone orientation) that were previously visible above the shutter button are now gone. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the camera to video mode. The next step is to try swiping in the opposite direction (left to right).\\n Step 105: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[799,916],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots icon located at approximately [799, 916] (center of bounding box [780, 880, 819, 953]). This action is expected to open a menu or reveal additional camera options, potentially including a way to switch to video mode. Actual Outcome: The swipe from left to right (from `[900, 250]` to `[900, 750]`) successfully revealed the camera mode selection options. The screen now displays \"Camera\" and \"Video\" options. \"Camera\" is currently selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the camera to video mode.

This action is an attempt to switch the camera mode from photo to video, as this is a common gesture in many camera applications. The current camera mode is photo, indicated by the camera shutter icon. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Video\\' option was successful. The camera app switched to video mode. The interface changed, removing the \\'Camera\\' and \\'Video\\' selection options and displaying a video record button at the bottom center. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully setting the camera to video mode.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[26,882],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the green video camera icon in the top right corner (center at approximately [26, 882]) to switch the camera to video mode. This icon is currently visible and tappable. This action is expected to change the camera interface to video recording mode, likely changing the central shutter button to a record button. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Camera app icon at [474, 393] was successful. The Camera app launched, and the screen now displays the camera\\'s viewfinder and controls. Specifically, a large camera icon (shutter button) is at the bottom center, and a video camera icon is in the top right. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Camera app and setting it to video mode.\\n Step 103: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to return from the image viewer to the camera interface. This action is expected to close the current image viewer and display the camera interface again. Actual Outcome: The tap on the three-dots icon at [799, 916] was successful. It revealed three new icons above the shutter button: a flash icon, a grid icon, and a phone orientation icon. These are likely camera settings or options. This action did not directly switch the camera to video mode, but it provided more information about the available controls. The agent is still in the camera app, and the goal is to switch to video mode.\\n Step 104: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[474,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the app drawer. The icon is a stylized camera and is labeled \\'Camera\\'. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe from right to left (from [900, 700] to [900, 300]) did not switch the camera to video mode. The shutter button is still a camera icon. The three icons (flash, grid, phone orientation) that were previously visible above the shutter button are now gone. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the camera to video mode. The next step is to try swiping in the opposite direction (left to right).\\n Step 105: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[799,916],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots icon located at approximately [799, 916] (center of bounding box [780, 880, 819, 953]). This action is expected to open a menu or reveal additional camera options, potentially including a way to switch to video mode. Actual Outcome: The swipe from left to right (from `[900, 250]` to `[900, 750]`) successfully revealed the camera mode selection options. The screen now displays \"Camera\" and \"Video\" options. \"Camera\" is currently selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the camera to video mode. The next step is to tap on the \"Video\" option.\\n Step 106: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,700],\"end_point\":[900,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from right to left (from [900, 700] to [900, 300]) across the lower part of the screen, near the shutter button. This action is an attempt to switch the camera mode from photo to video, as this is a common gesture in many camera applications. The current camera mode is photo, indicated by the camera shutter icon. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Video\\' option was successful. The camera app switched to video mode. The interface changed, removing the \\'Camera\\' and \\'Video\\' selection options and displaying a video record button at the bottom center. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully setting the camera to video mode.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 109: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[921,498],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the video record button (white camcorder icon) located at the bottom center of the screen (center at approximately [921, 498]) to start recording a video. This icon is currently visible and tappable. This action is expected to start the video recording, and the icon might change to a stop button.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The next step is to tap on the \"Video\" option.\\n Step 106: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,700],\"end_point\":[900,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from right to left (from [900, 700] to [900, 300]) across the lower part of the screen, near the shutter button. This action is an attempt to switch the camera mode from photo to video, as this is a common gesture in many camera applications. The current camera mode is photo, indicated by the camera shutter icon. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Video\\' option was successful. The camera app switched to video mode. The interface changed, removing the \\'Camera\\' and \\'Video\\' selection options and displaying a video record button at the bottom center. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully setting the camera to video mode.\\n Step 107: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,250],\"end_point\":[900,750],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from left to right across the screen, near the shutter button area (from `[900, 250]` to `[900, 750]`). This action is an attempt to switch the camera to video mode. The camera is currently in photo mode, as indicated by the camera shutter icon. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the video record button at [921, 498] was successful. The video recording started, which is confirmed by the record button changing to a stop button (a white square) and a timer appearing in the top left corner showing \"00:03\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of recording and stopping one video.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 220], \\'text\\': \\'JdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Jxv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [86, 131, 103, 236], \\'text\\': \\'00.03\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [78, 54, 109, 271]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [888, 421, 957, 581]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

It revealed three new icons above the shutter button: a flash icon, a grid icon, and a phone orientation icon. These are likely camera settings or options. This action did not directly switch the camera to video mode, but it provided more information about the available controls. The agent is still in the camera app, and the goal is to switch to video mode.\\n Step 104: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[474,393],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Camera app icon, which is located in the app drawer. The icon is a stylized camera and is labeled \\'Camera\\'. This action is expected to open the Camera app. Actual Outcome: The swipe from right to left (from [900, 700] to [900, 300]) did not switch the camera to video mode. The shutter button is still a camera icon. The three icons (flash, grid, phone orientation) that were previously visible above the shutter button are now gone. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the camera to video mode. The next step is to try swiping in the opposite direction (left to right).\\n Step 105: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[799,916],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dots icon located at approximately [799, 916] (center of bounding box [780, 880, 819, 953]). This action is expected to open a menu or reveal additional camera options, potentially including a way to switch to video mode. Actual Outcome: The swipe from left to right (from `[900, 250]` to `[900, 750]`) successfully revealed the camera mode selection options. The screen now displays \"Camera\" and \"Video\" options. \"Camera\" is currently selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of setting the camera to video mode.

This action is an attempt to switch the camera mode from photo to video, as this is a common gesture in many camera applications. The current camera mode is photo, indicated by the camera shutter icon. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Video\\' option was successful. The camera app switched to video mode. The interface changed, removing the \\'Camera\\' and \\'Video\\' selection options and displaying a video record button at the bottom center.

This action is an attempt to switch the camera to video mode. The camera is currently in photo mode, as indicated by the camera shutter icon. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the video record button at [921, 498] was successful.

The second screenshot shows that the recording has stopped: the timer is no longer visible, the record button has changed to a white video camera icon, and a small thumbnail of the recorded video has appeared in the bottom right corner.', 'StepByStepExplanation': 'The last action was to tap the stop recording button. The screenshots confirm that the video recording stopped successfully. The timer disappeared, the record button changed to a video camera icon, and a thumbnail of the recorded video appeared. This means the active Subgoal (ID 2: Record and Stop One Video) is now completed. The `videoRecordingCompleted` memory entry will be updated to reflect this.

A new subgoal will be created for this purpose.', 'ActionOutcomeDescription': 'The tap on the stop recording button at [922, 501] was successful. The video recording stopped. This is confirmed by the disappearance of the timer, the change of the record button from a red stop icon to a white video camera icon, and the appearance of a video thumbnail in the bottom right corner.
