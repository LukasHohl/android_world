Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Magenta color swatch located at the top of the page. This swatch is the middle of the three color swatches, with an approximate center at [157, 500] (bounding box [129, 434, 185, 566]). This action is intended to select Magenta as the active drawing color. The canvas currently has one Teal dot. If successful, the Magenta swatch should change appearance (e.g., become darker). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Magenta color swatch (approximate center [157, 500]) at the top of the page was successful. The Magenta swatch changed its appearance to a darker shade, and the previously selected Teal swatch reverted to its lighter shade, indicating that Magenta is now the selected drawing color. This action moves the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the second of the three required colors has been selected. The canvas still contains one Teal dot.\\n Step 51: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 500]. The canvas currently has one Teal dot at [350, 500]. The Magenta color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Magenta color. If successful, a Magenta mark will appear at [400, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [400, 500] after selecting the Magenta color swatch was successful. A Magenta dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas, next to the existing Teal dot. This confirms that Magenta was correctly selected and can be used for drawing. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the second of the three required colors has now been successfully used in the drawing.\\n Step 52: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,647],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Dark Blue color swatch located at the top right of the three main color swatches. The swatch has a bounding box of [129, 583, 185, 711], and the tap will be near its center at [157, 647]. This action is intended to select Dark Blue as the active drawing color. The canvas currently has one Teal dot and one Magenta dot. If successful, the Dark Blue swatch should change appearance (e.g., become darker), and the Magenta swatch should revert to its lighter shade. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Dark Blue color swatch (approximate center [157, 647]) at the top of the page was successful. The Dark Blue swatch changed its appearance to a darker shade, and the previously selected Magenta swatch reverted to its lighter shade, indicating that Dark Blue is now the selected drawing color. This action moves the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the third of the three required colors has been selected. The canvas still contains one Teal dot and one Magenta dot.\\n Step 53: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[450,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [450, 500]. The canvas currently has one Teal dot (at approx. [350, 500]) and one Magenta dot (at approx. [400, 500]). The Dark Blue color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Dark Blue color. If successful, a Dark Blue mark will appear at [450, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [450, 500] after selecting the Dark Blue color swatch was successful. A Dark Blue dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas, next to the existing Teal and Magenta dots. This confirms that Dark Blue was correctly selected and can be used for drawing. This action completed Subgoal 5, as the third of the three required colors has now been successfully used in the drawing.\\n Step 54: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Submit\\' button. The \\'Submit\\' button is located at the bottom right of the screen, with text \\'Submit\\'. The bounding box is `[729, 497, 765, 673]`. This action is intended to submit the drawing made on the canvas. If successful, the drawing will be submitted, and the page might change or show a confirmation. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Submit\\' button at [747, 585] was performed. There was no visual change on the screen after the tap. It is assumed that the drawing was submitted successfully, as per the user\\'s instruction to \\'hit submit\\'. This action completed Subgoal 6.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'17.03\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 712, 65, 797], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [120, 47, 152, 318], \\'text\\': \\'Tue; May 13\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 336, 722, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Gmail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 561, 722, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [704, 781, 722, 921], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [775, 295, 872, 709], \\'text\\': \\'0 (9\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 72, 855, 232]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 764, 856, 929]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 298, 857, 466]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 535, 858, 706]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 536, 729, 694]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 764, 729, 927]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 299, 731, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 702, 947, 794]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [893, 802, 952, 920]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 822, 40, 900]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then navigate the X to the bottom-right cell, by using the direction buttons.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 50: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Magenta color swatch located at the top of the page. This swatch is the middle of the three color swatches, with an approximate center at [157, 500] (bounding box [129, 434, 185, 566]). This action is intended to select Magenta as the active drawing color. The canvas currently has one Teal dot. If successful, the Magenta swatch should change appearance (e.g., become darker). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Magenta color swatch (approximate center [157, 500]) at the top of the page was successful. The Magenta swatch changed its appearance to a darker shade, and the previously selected Teal swatch reverted to its lighter shade, indicating that Magenta is now the selected drawing color. This action moves the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the second of the three required colors has been selected. The canvas still contains one Teal dot.\\n Step 51: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 500]. The canvas currently has one Teal dot at [350, 500]. The Magenta color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Magenta color. If successful, a Magenta mark will appear at [400, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [400, 500] after selecting the Magenta color swatch was successful. A Magenta dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas, next to the existing Teal dot. This confirms that Magenta was correctly selected and can be used for drawing. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the second of the three required colors has now been successfully used in the drawing.\\n Step 52: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,647],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Dark Blue color swatch located at the top right of the three main color swatches. The swatch has a bounding box of [129, 583, 185, 711], and the tap will be near its center at [157, 647]. This action is intended to select Dark Blue as the active drawing color. The canvas currently has one Teal dot and one Magenta dot. If successful, the Dark Blue swatch should change appearance (e.g., become darker), and the Magenta swatch should revert to its lighter shade. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Dark Blue color swatch (approximate center [157, 647]) at the top of the page was successful. The Dark Blue swatch changed its appearance to a darker shade, and the previously selected Magenta swatch reverted to its lighter shade, indicating that Dark Blue is now the selected drawing color. This action moves the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the third of the three required colors has been selected. The canvas still contains one Teal dot and one Magenta dot.\\n Step 53: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[450,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [450, 500]. The canvas currently has one Teal dot (at approx. [350, 500]) and one Magenta dot (at approx. [400, 500]). The Dark Blue color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Dark Blue color. If successful, a Dark Blue mark will appear at [450, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [450, 500] after selecting the Dark Blue color swatch was successful. A Dark Blue dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas, next to the existing Teal and Magenta dots. This confirms that Dark Blue was correctly selected and can be used for drawing. This action completed Subgoal 5, as the third of the three required colors has now been successfully used in the drawing.\\n Step 54: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Submit\\' button. The \\'Submit\\' button is located at the bottom right of the screen, with text \\'Submit\\'. The bounding box is `[729, 497, 765, 673]`. This action is intended to submit the drawing made on the canvas. If successful, the drawing will be submitted, and the page might change or show a confirmation. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Submit\\' button at [747, 585] was performed. There was no visual change on the screen after the tap. It is assumed that the drawing was submitted successfully, as per the user\\'s instruction to \\'hit submit\\'. This action completed Subgoal 6.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 55: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (start_point [900, 500]) towards the top (end_point [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the File Manager app can be found. The current screen is the home screen.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"},{\"VariableName\":\"XElementNavigationToBottomRightConfirmation\",\"Content\":\"\",\"Status\":\"This piece of information is sought. No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The canvas currently has one Teal dot at [350, 500]. The Magenta color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Magenta color. If successful, a Magenta mark will appear at [400, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [400, 500] after selecting the Magenta color swatch was successful. A Magenta dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas, next to the existing Teal dot. This confirms that Magenta was correctly selected and can be used for drawing. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the second of the three required colors has now been successfully used in the drawing.\\n Step 52: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,647],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Dark Blue color swatch located at the top right of the three main color swatches. The swatch has a bounding box of [129, 583, 185, 711], and the tap will be near its center at [157, 647]. This action is intended to select Dark Blue as the active drawing color. The canvas currently has one Teal dot and one Magenta dot. If successful, the Dark Blue swatch should change appearance (e.g., become darker), and the Magenta swatch should revert to its lighter shade. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Dark Blue color swatch (approximate center [157, 647]) at the top of the page was successful. The Dark Blue swatch changed its appearance to a darker shade, and the previously selected Magenta swatch reverted to its lighter shade, indicating that Dark Blue is now the selected drawing color. This action moves the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the third of the three required colors has been selected. The canvas still contains one Teal dot and one Magenta dot.\\n Step 53: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[450,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [450, 500]. The canvas currently has one Teal dot (at approx. [350, 500]) and one Magenta dot (at approx. [400, 500]). The Dark Blue color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Dark Blue color. If successful, a Dark Blue mark will appear at [450, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [450, 500] after selecting the Dark Blue color swatch was successful. A Dark Blue dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas, next to the existing Teal and Magenta dots. This confirms that Dark Blue was correctly selected and can be used for drawing. This action completed Subgoal 5, as the third of the three required colors has now been successfully used in the drawing.\\n Step 54: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Submit\\' button. The \\'Submit\\' button is located at the bottom right of the screen, with text \\'Submit\\'. The bounding box is `[729, 497, 765, 673]`. This action is intended to submit the drawing made on the canvas. If successful, the drawing will be submitted, and the page might change or show a confirmation. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Submit\\' button at [747, 585] was performed. There was no visual change on the screen after the tap. It is assumed that the drawing was submitted successfully, as per the user\\'s instruction to \\'hit submit\\'. This action completed Subgoal 6.\\n Step 55: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (start_point [900, 500]) towards the top (end_point [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the File Manager app can be found. The current screen is the home screen. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a view displaying all installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the app drawer is now open, allowing for the selection of the File Manager app.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then navigate the X to the bottom-right cell, by using the direction buttons.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 51: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[400,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [400, 500]. The canvas currently has one Teal dot at [350, 500]. The Magenta color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Magenta color. If successful, a Magenta mark will appear at [400, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [400, 500] after selecting the Magenta color swatch was successful. A Magenta dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas, next to the existing Teal dot. This confirms that Magenta was correctly selected and can be used for drawing. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the second of the three required colors has now been successfully used in the drawing.\\n Step 52: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,647],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Dark Blue color swatch located at the top right of the three main color swatches. The swatch has a bounding box of [129, 583, 185, 711], and the tap will be near its center at [157, 647]. This action is intended to select Dark Blue as the active drawing color. The canvas currently has one Teal dot and one Magenta dot. If successful, the Dark Blue swatch should change appearance (e.g., become darker), and the Magenta swatch should revert to its lighter shade. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Dark Blue color swatch (approximate center [157, 647]) at the top of the page was successful. The Dark Blue swatch changed its appearance to a darker shade, and the previously selected Magenta swatch reverted to its lighter shade, indicating that Dark Blue is now the selected drawing color. This action moves the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the third of the three required colors has been selected. The canvas still contains one Teal dot and one Magenta dot.\\n Step 53: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[450,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [450, 500]. The canvas currently has one Teal dot (at approx. [350, 500]) and one Magenta dot (at approx. [400, 500]). The Dark Blue color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Dark Blue color. If successful, a Dark Blue mark will appear at [450, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [450, 500] after selecting the Dark Blue color swatch was successful. A Dark Blue dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas, next to the existing Teal and Magenta dots. This confirms that Dark Blue was correctly selected and can be used for drawing. This action completed Subgoal 5, as the third of the three required colors has now been successfully used in the drawing.\\n Step 54: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Submit\\' button. The \\'Submit\\' button is located at the bottom right of the screen, with text \\'Submit\\'. The bounding box is `[729, 497, 765, 673]`. This action is intended to submit the drawing made on the canvas. If successful, the drawing will be submitted, and the page might change or show a confirmation. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Submit\\' button at [747, 585] was performed. There was no visual change on the screen after the tap. It is assumed that the drawing was submitted successfully, as per the user\\'s instruction to \\'hit submit\\'. This action completed Subgoal 6.\\n Step 55: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (start_point [900, 500]) towards the top (end_point [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the File Manager app can be found. The current screen is the home screen. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a view displaying all installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the app drawer is now open, allowing for the selection of the File Manager app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 56: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[737,169],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" app icon. The icon is located in the app drawer and has the text \"Files\" below it. The bounding box for the icon is [686, 78, 789, 260]. Tapping this icon should open the File Manager app. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open File Manager App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app (e.g., \\\\\"Files\\\\\") is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"},{\"VariableName\":\"XElementNavigationToBottomRightConfirmation\",\"Content\":\"\",\"Status\":\"This piece of information is sought. No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 52: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,647],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Dark Blue color swatch located at the top right of the three main color swatches. The swatch has a bounding box of [129, 583, 185, 711], and the tap will be near its center at [157, 647]. This action is intended to select Dark Blue as the active drawing color. The canvas currently has one Teal dot and one Magenta dot. If successful, the Dark Blue swatch should change appearance (e.g., become darker), and the Magenta swatch should revert to its lighter shade. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Dark Blue color swatch (approximate center [157, 647]) at the top of the page was successful. The Dark Blue swatch changed its appearance to a darker shade, and the previously selected Magenta swatch reverted to its lighter shade, indicating that Dark Blue is now the selected drawing color. This action moves the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the third of the three required colors has been selected. The canvas still contains one Teal dot and one Magenta dot.\\n Step 53: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[450,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [450, 500]. The canvas currently has one Teal dot (at approx. [350, 500]) and one Magenta dot (at approx. [400, 500]). The Dark Blue color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Dark Blue color. If successful, a Dark Blue mark will appear at [450, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [450, 500] after selecting the Dark Blue color swatch was successful. A Dark Blue dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas, next to the existing Teal and Magenta dots. This confirms that Dark Blue was correctly selected and can be used for drawing. This action completed Subgoal 5, as the third of the three required colors has now been successfully used in the drawing.\\n Step 54: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Submit\\' button. The \\'Submit\\' button is located at the bottom right of the screen, with text \\'Submit\\'. The bounding box is `[729, 497, 765, 673]`. This action is intended to submit the drawing made on the canvas. If successful, the drawing will be submitted, and the page might change or show a confirmation. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Submit\\' button at [747, 585] was performed. There was no visual change on the screen after the tap. It is assumed that the drawing was submitted successfully, as per the user\\'s instruction to \\'hit submit\\'. This action completed Subgoal 6.\\n Step 55: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (start_point [900, 500]) towards the top (end_point [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the File Manager app can be found. The current screen is the home screen. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a view displaying all installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the app drawer is now open, allowing for the selection of the File Manager app.\\n Step 56: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[737,169],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" app icon. The icon is located in the app drawer and has the text \"Files\" below it. The bounding box for the icon is [686, 78, 789, 260]. Tapping this icon should open the File Manager app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \"Files\" app icon was successful. The \"Files\" app opened, and the screen changed to display the \"Downloads\" folder content. The file \"task.html\" is visible on the screen. This action directly led to the completion of Subgoal 1 and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 2.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'17.05\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 175, 91, 425], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [488, 175, 504, 326], \\'text\\': \\'task html\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 179, 523, 367], \\'text\\': \\'4.77 kB 17.03\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 545, 205, 780]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 313, 205, 533]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 795, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 791, 94, 859]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 861, 94, 971]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [490, 83, 523, 168]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 55, 143, 235]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 818, 40, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [48, 116, 94, 421]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [231, 841, 259, 923]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [282, 59, 537, 497]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [367, 216, 395, 278]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 40, 38, 192]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then navigate the X to the bottom-right cell, by using the direction buttons.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 52: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[157,647],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Dark Blue color swatch located at the top right of the three main color swatches. The swatch has a bounding box of [129, 583, 185, 711], and the tap will be near its center at [157, 647]. This action is intended to select Dark Blue as the active drawing color. The canvas currently has one Teal dot and one Magenta dot. If successful, the Dark Blue swatch should change appearance (e.g., become darker), and the Magenta swatch should revert to its lighter shade. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Dark Blue color swatch (approximate center [157, 647]) at the top of the page was successful. The Dark Blue swatch changed its appearance to a darker shade, and the previously selected Magenta swatch reverted to its lighter shade, indicating that Dark Blue is now the selected drawing color. This action moves the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5, as the third of the three required colors has been selected. The canvas still contains one Teal dot and one Magenta dot.\\n Step 53: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[450,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [450, 500]. The canvas currently has one Teal dot (at approx. [350, 500]) and one Magenta dot (at approx. [400, 500]). The Dark Blue color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Dark Blue color. If successful, a Dark Blue mark will appear at [450, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [450, 500] after selecting the Dark Blue color swatch was successful. A Dark Blue dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas, next to the existing Teal and Magenta dots. This confirms that Dark Blue was correctly selected and can be used for drawing. This action completed Subgoal 5, as the third of the three required colors has now been successfully used in the drawing.\\n Step 54: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Submit\\' button. The \\'Submit\\' button is located at the bottom right of the screen, with text \\'Submit\\'. The bounding box is `[729, 497, 765, 673]`. This action is intended to submit the drawing made on the canvas. If successful, the drawing will be submitted, and the page might change or show a confirmation. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Submit\\' button at [747, 585] was performed. There was no visual change on the screen after the tap. It is assumed that the drawing was submitted successfully, as per the user\\'s instruction to \\'hit submit\\'. This action completed Subgoal 6.\\n Step 55: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (start_point [900, 500]) towards the top (end_point [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the File Manager app can be found. The current screen is the home screen. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a view displaying all installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the app drawer is now open, allowing for the selection of the File Manager app.\\n Step 56: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[737,169],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" app icon. The icon is located in the app drawer and has the text \"Files\" below it. The bounding box for the icon is [686, 78, 789, 260]. Tapping this icon should open the File Manager app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \"Files\" app icon was successful. The \"Files\" app opened, and the screen changed to display the \"Downloads\" folder content. The file \"task.html\" is visible on the screen. This action directly led to the completion of Subgoal 1 and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 2.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 57: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[409,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \"task.html\" in the Downloads folder. The file item has a bounding box of `[282, 59, 537, 497]`. Tapping this should initiate opening the file, likely prompting for an app to open it with. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open File Manager App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app (e.g., \\\\\"Files\\\\\") is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[450,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [450, 500]. The canvas currently has one Teal dot (at approx. [350, 500]) and one Magenta dot (at approx. [400, 500]). The Dark Blue color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Dark Blue color. If successful, a Dark Blue mark will appear at [450, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [450, 500] after selecting the Dark Blue color swatch was successful. A Dark Blue dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas, next to the existing Teal and Magenta dots. This confirms that Dark Blue was correctly selected and can be used for drawing. This action completed Subgoal 5, as the third of the three required colors has now been successfully used in the drawing.\\n Step 54: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Submit\\' button. The \\'Submit\\' button is located at the bottom right of the screen, with text \\'Submit\\'. The bounding box is `[729, 497, 765, 673]`. This action is intended to submit the drawing made on the canvas. If successful, the drawing will be submitted, and the page might change or show a confirmation. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Submit\\' button at [747, 585] was performed. There was no visual change on the screen after the tap. It is assumed that the drawing was submitted successfully, as per the user\\'s instruction to \\'hit submit\\'. This action completed Subgoal 6.\\n Step 55: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (start_point [900, 500]) towards the top (end_point [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the File Manager app can be found. The current screen is the home screen. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a view displaying all installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the app drawer is now open, allowing for the selection of the File Manager app.\\n Step 56: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[737,169],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" app icon. The icon is located in the app drawer and has the text \"Files\" below it. The bounding box for the icon is [686, 78, 789, 260]. Tapping this icon should open the File Manager app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \"Files\" app icon was successful. The \"Files\" app opened, and the screen changed to display the \"Downloads\" folder content. The file \"task.html\" is visible on the screen. This action directly led to the completion of Subgoal 1 and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 2.\\n Step 57: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[409,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \"task.html\" in the Downloads folder. The file item has a bounding box of `[282, 59, 537, 497]`. Tapping this should initiate opening the file, likely prompting for an app to open it with. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'task.html\\' at [409, 278] did not result in any observable change on the screen. The file \\'task.html\\' did not open, and no dialog (e.g., \\'Open with\\') appeared. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The tap might not have registered correctly, or there might be an issue with how the system handles this file type without a default app or without showing a chooser.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'17.05\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 175, 91, 425], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [488, 175, 504, 326], \\'text\\': \\'task html\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 179, 523, 367], \\'text\\': \\'4.77 kB 17.03\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 545, 205, 780]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 313, 205, 533]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 795, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 791, 94, 859]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 861, 94, 972]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [490, 83, 523, 168]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 55, 143, 235]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 818, 40, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [48, 115, 94, 421]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [231, 841, 259, 923]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [282, 59, 537, 497]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [366, 217, 396, 277]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 39, 38, 192]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'17:06\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 91, 381], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0 dY: 0.0 selected\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 710, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [488, 175, 504, 326], \\'text\\': \\'task html\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 178, 524, 367], \\'text\\': \\'4.77 kB 17.03\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 546, 205, 781]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 313, 205, 533]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 795, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [476, 54, 535, 496]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 791, 94, 851]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 37, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 855, 94, 946]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [232, 840, 259, 924]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 39, 37, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 819, 42, 943]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nOpen the file task.html in Downloads in the file manager; when prompted open it with Chrome. Then navigate the X to the bottom-right cell, by using the direction buttons.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 53: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[450,500],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the canvas at coordinates [450, 500]. The canvas currently has one Teal dot (at approx. [350, 500]) and one Magenta dot (at approx. [400, 500]). The Dark Blue color swatch at the top of the page was tapped in the previous step and appears selected. This action is intended to create a mark on the canvas with the selected Dark Blue color. If successful, a Dark Blue mark will appear at [450, 500]. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the canvas at [450, 500] after selecting the Dark Blue color swatch was successful. A Dark Blue dot was drawn at the specified location on the canvas, next to the existing Teal and Magenta dots. This confirms that Dark Blue was correctly selected and can be used for drawing. This action completed Subgoal 5, as the third of the three required colors has now been successfully used in the drawing.\\n Step 54: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Submit\\' button. The \\'Submit\\' button is located at the bottom right of the screen, with text \\'Submit\\'. The bounding box is `[729, 497, 765, 673]`. This action is intended to submit the drawing made on the canvas. If successful, the drawing will be submitted, and the page might change or show a confirmation. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Submit\\' button at [747, 585] was performed. There was no visual change on the screen after the tap. It is assumed that the drawing was submitted successfully, as per the user\\'s instruction to \\'hit submit\\'. This action completed Subgoal 6.\\n Step 55: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (start_point [900, 500]) towards the top (end_point [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the File Manager app can be found. The current screen is the home screen. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a view displaying all installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the app drawer is now open, allowing for the selection of the File Manager app.\\n Step 56: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[737,169],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" app icon. The icon is located in the app drawer and has the text \"Files\" below it. The bounding box for the icon is [686, 78, 789, 260]. Tapping this icon should open the File Manager app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \"Files\" app icon was successful. The \"Files\" app opened, and the screen changed to display the \"Downloads\" folder content. The file \"task.html\" is visible on the screen. This action directly led to the completion of Subgoal 1 and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 2.\\n Step 57: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[409,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \"task.html\" in the Downloads folder. The file item has a bounding box of `[282, 59, 537, 497]`. Tapping this should initiate opening the file, likely prompting for an app to open it with. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'task.html\\' at [409, 278] did not result in any observable change on the screen. The file \\'task.html\\' did not open, and no dialog (e.g., \\'Open with\\') appeared. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The tap might not have registered correctly, or there might be an issue with how the system handles this file type without a default app or without showing a chooser.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 58: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[409,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \"task.html\" file, which is located at approximately [409, 278]. The file item has a bounding box of `[282, 59, 537, 497]`. This action is intended to bring up a context menu, which might contain options to open the file, such as \"Open\" or \"Open with\". The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open File Manager App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app (e.g., \\\\\"Files\\\\\") is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"},{\"VariableName\":\"XElementNavigationToBottomRightConfirmation\",\"Content\":\"\",\"Status\":\"This piece of information is sought. No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The next step is to interact with the newly appeared options, specifically the three-dot menu.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'17:06\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 91, 381], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0 dY: 0.0 selected\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 710, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [488, 175, 504, 326], \\'text\\': \\'task html\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 178, 524, 367], \\'text\\': \\'4.77 kB 17.03\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 546, 205, 781]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 313, 205, 533]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 795, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [476, 54, 535, 496]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 791, 94, 851]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 37, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 855, 94, 946]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [232, 840, 259, 924]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 39, 37, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 819, 42, 943]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then navigate the X to the bottom-right cell, by using the direction buttons.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 54: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[747,585],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Submit\\' button. The \\'Submit\\' button is located at the bottom right of the screen, with text \\'Submit\\'. The bounding box is `[729, 497, 765, 673]`. This action is intended to submit the drawing made on the canvas. If successful, the drawing will be submitted, and the page might change or show a confirmation. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Submit\\' button at [747, 585] was performed. There was no visual change on the screen after the tap. It is assumed that the drawing was submitted successfully, as per the user\\'s instruction to \\'hit submit\\'. This action completed Subgoal 6.\\n Step 55: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (start_point [900, 500]) towards the top (end_point [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the File Manager app can be found. The current screen is the home screen. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a view displaying all installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the app drawer is now open, allowing for the selection of the File Manager app.\\n Step 56: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[737,169],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" app icon. The icon is located in the app drawer and has the text \"Files\" below it. The bounding box for the icon is [686, 78, 789, 260]. Tapping this icon should open the File Manager app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \"Files\" app icon was successful. The \"Files\" app opened, and the screen changed to display the \"Downloads\" folder content. The file \"task.html\" is visible on the screen. This action directly led to the completion of Subgoal 1 and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 2.\\n Step 57: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[409,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \"task.html\" in the Downloads folder. The file item has a bounding box of `[282, 59, 537, 497]`. Tapping this should initiate opening the file, likely prompting for an app to open it with. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'task.html\\' at [409, 278] did not result in any observable change on the screen. The file \\'task.html\\' did not open, and no dialog (e.g., \\'Open with\\') appeared. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The tap might not have registered correctly, or there might be an issue with how the system handles this file type without a default app or without showing a chooser.\\n Step 58: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[409,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \"task.html\" file, which is located at approximately [409, 278]. The file item has a bounding box of `[282, 59, 537, 497]`. This action is intended to bring up a context menu, which might contain options to open the file, such as \"Open\" or \"Open with\". Actual Outcome: The long press on `task.html` at [409, 278] successfully selected the file. This is evident from the blue checkmark next to `task.html` and the updated top bar showing \"1 selected\" along with share, delete, and more options icons. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as selecting the file is a necessary step to access options like \"Open\" or \"Open with\". The next step is to interact with the newly appeared options, specifically the three-dot menu.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 59: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then navigate the X to the bottom-right cell, by using the direction buttons.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 55: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (start_point [900, 500]) towards the top (end_point [300, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the File Manager app can be found. The current screen is the home screen. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen to a view displaying all installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the app drawer is now open, allowing for the selection of the File Manager app.\\n Step 56: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[737,169],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" app icon. The icon is located in the app drawer and has the text \"Files\" below it. The bounding box for the icon is [686, 78, 789, 260]. Tapping this icon should open the File Manager app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \"Files\" app icon was successful. The \"Files\" app opened, and the screen changed to display the \"Downloads\" folder content. The file \"task.html\" is visible on the screen. This action directly led to the completion of Subgoal 1 and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 2.\\n Step 57: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[409,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \"task.html\" in the Downloads folder. The file item has a bounding box of `[282, 59, 537, 497]`. Tapping this should initiate opening the file, likely prompting for an app to open it with. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'task.html\\' at [409, 278] did not result in any observable change on the screen. The file \\'task.html\\' did not open, and no dialog (e.g., \\'Open with\\') appeared. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The tap might not have registered correctly, or there might be an issue with how the system handles this file type without a default app or without showing a chooser.\\n Step 58: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[409,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \"task.html\" file, which is located at approximately [409, 278]. The file item has a bounding box of `[282, 59, 537, 497]`. This action is intended to bring up a context menu, which might contain options to open the file, such as \"Open\" or \"Open with\". Actual Outcome: The long press on `task.html` at [409, 278] successfully selected the file. This is evident from the blue checkmark next to `task.html` and the updated top bar showing \"1 selected\" along with share, delete, and more options icons. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as selecting the file is a necessary step to access options like \"Open\" or \"Open with\". The next step is to interact with the newly appeared options, specifically the three-dot menu.\\n Step 59: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (more options) located in the top right corner. The icon\\'s bounding box is `[66, 855, 94, 946]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 900] was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing several options for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This menu includes \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Open with\\' option is now accessible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 60: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text has a bounding box of `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. Tapping this option should bring up a dialog asking which app to use to open the file. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open File Manager App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app (e.g., \\\\\"Files\\\\\") is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 56: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[737,169],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" app icon. The icon is located in the app drawer and has the text \"Files\" below it. The bounding box for the icon is [686, 78, 789, 260]. Tapping this icon should open the File Manager app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \"Files\" app icon was successful. The \"Files\" app opened, and the screen changed to display the \"Downloads\" folder content. The file \"task.html\" is visible on the screen. This action directly led to the completion of Subgoal 1 and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 2.\\n Step 57: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[409,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \"task.html\" in the Downloads folder. The file item has a bounding box of `[282, 59, 537, 497]`. Tapping this should initiate opening the file, likely prompting for an app to open it with. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'task.html\\' at [409, 278] did not result in any observable change on the screen. The file \\'task.html\\' did not open, and no dialog (e.g., \\'Open with\\') appeared. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The tap might not have registered correctly, or there might be an issue with how the system handles this file type without a default app or without showing a chooser.\\n Step 58: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[409,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \"task.html\" file, which is located at approximately [409, 278]. The file item has a bounding box of `[282, 59, 537, 497]`. This action is intended to bring up a context menu, which might contain options to open the file, such as \"Open\" or \"Open with\". Actual Outcome: The long press on `task.html` at [409, 278] successfully selected the file. This is evident from the blue checkmark next to `task.html` and the updated top bar showing \"1 selected\" along with share, delete, and more options icons. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as selecting the file is a necessary step to access options like \"Open\" or \"Open with\". The next step is to interact with the newly appeared options, specifically the three-dot menu.\\n Step 59: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (more options) located in the top right corner. The icon\\'s bounding box is `[66, 855, 94, 946]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 900] was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing several options for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This menu includes \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Open with\\' option is now accessible.\\n Step 60: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text has a bounding box of `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. Tapping this option should bring up a dialog asking which app to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at [134, 630] was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, prompting the user to choose an application to open \\'task.html\\'. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully completing Subgoal 2.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'17.07\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'IXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 205, 91, 379], \\'text\\': \\'selected\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 57, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 271], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 55, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [488, 175, 504, 326], \\'text\\': \\'task html\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 179, 523, 367], \\'text\\': \\'4.77 kB 17.03\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 70, 942, 182], \\'text\\': \\'Chrome\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 287, 942, 469], \\'text\\': \\'HTML Viewer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 577, 942, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Markor\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 547, 205, 779]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 796, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 57, 205, 297]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 314, 205, 532]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [858, 556, 947, 694]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [859, 57, 945, 193]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [858, 307, 945, 447]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [225, 828, 271, 939]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 54, 145, 234]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [282, 58, 540, 489]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 820, 35, 899]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 905, 35, 942]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen.

To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible.

Then navigate the X to the bottom-right cell, by using the direction buttons.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 56: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[737,169],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Files\" app icon. The icon is located in the app drawer and has the text \"Files\" below it. The bounding box for the icon is [686, 78, 789, 260]. Tapping this icon should open the File Manager app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \"Files\" app icon was successful. The \"Files\" app opened, and the screen changed to display the \"Downloads\" folder content. The file \"task.html\" is visible on the screen. This action directly led to the completion of Subgoal 1 and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 2.\\n Step 57: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[409,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \"task.html\" in the Downloads folder. The file item has a bounding box of `[282, 59, 537, 497]`. Tapping this should initiate opening the file, likely prompting for an app to open it with. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'task.html\\' at [409, 278] did not result in any observable change on the screen. The file \\'task.html\\' did not open, and no dialog (e.g., \\'Open with\\') appeared. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The tap might not have registered correctly, or there might be an issue with how the system handles this file type without a default app or without showing a chooser.\\n Step 58: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[409,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \"task.html\" file, which is located at approximately [409, 278]. The file item has a bounding box of `[282, 59, 537, 497]`. This action is intended to bring up a context menu, which might contain options to open the file, such as \"Open\" or \"Open with\". Actual Outcome: The long press on `task.html` at [409, 278] successfully selected the file. This is evident from the blue checkmark next to `task.html` and the updated top bar showing \"1 selected\" along with share, delete, and more options icons. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as selecting the file is a necessary step to access options like \"Open\" or \"Open with\". The next step is to interact with the newly appeared options, specifically the three-dot menu.\\n Step 59: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (more options) located in the top right corner. The icon\\'s bounding box is `[66, 855, 94, 946]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 900] was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing several options for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This menu includes \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Open with\\' option is now accessible.\\n Step 60: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text has a bounding box of `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. Tapping this option should bring up a dialog asking which app to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at [134, 630] was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, prompting the user to choose an application to open \\'task.html\\'. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully completing Subgoal 2.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 61: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,125],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with a bounding box of `[859, 57, 945, 193]`. Tapping this should open the \\'task.html\\' file in the Chrome browser. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open File Manager App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app (e.g., \\\\\"Files\\\\\") is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"},{\"VariableName\":\"XElementNavigationToBottomRightConfirmation\",\"Content\":\"\",\"Status\":\"This piece of information is sought. No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 57: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[409,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \"task.html\" in the Downloads folder. The file item has a bounding box of `[282, 59, 537, 497]`. Tapping this should initiate opening the file, likely prompting for an app to open it with. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'task.html\\' at [409, 278] did not result in any observable change on the screen. The file \\'task.html\\' did not open, and no dialog (e.g., \\'Open with\\') appeared. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The tap might not have registered correctly, or there might be an issue with how the system handles this file type without a default app or without showing a chooser.\\n Step 58: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[409,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \"task.html\" file, which is located at approximately [409, 278]. The file item has a bounding box of `[282, 59, 537, 497]`. This action is intended to bring up a context menu, which might contain options to open the file, such as \"Open\" or \"Open with\". Actual Outcome: The long press on `task.html` at [409, 278] successfully selected the file. This is evident from the blue checkmark next to `task.html` and the updated top bar showing \"1 selected\" along with share, delete, and more options icons. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as selecting the file is a necessary step to access options like \"Open\" or \"Open with\". The next step is to interact with the newly appeared options, specifically the three-dot menu.\\n Step 59: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (more options) located in the top right corner. The icon\\'s bounding box is `[66, 855, 94, 946]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 900] was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing several options for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This menu includes \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Open with\\' option is now accessible.\\n Step 60: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text has a bounding box of `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. Tapping this option should bring up a dialog asking which app to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at [134, 630] was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, prompting the user to choose an application to open \\'task.html\\'. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully completing Subgoal 2.\\n Step 61: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,125],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with a bounding box of `[859, 57, 945, 193]`. Tapping this should open the \\'task.html\\' file in the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at [902, 125] in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful in launching the Chrome browser. The screen changed to display the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' page. This page requires the user to \\'Accept & continue\\' before proceeding. The \\'task.html\\' file is not yet open. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, as Chrome is now the active application, but an intermediate step (accepting terms) is required before the file can be displayed.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'17.07\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [494, 256, 519, 750], \\'text\\': \\'Welcome to Chrome\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [559, 55, 627, 825], \\'text\\': \\'By using Chrome; you agree to the Google Terms of Service; and the Google Chrome and ChromeOS Additional Terms of Service.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [649, 159, 697, 835], \\'text\\': \\'Help make Chrome better by sending usage statistics and crash reports to Google.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 355, 933, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Accept & continue\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [899, 297, 944, 702]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 818, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [52, 852, 67, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [53, 420, 67, 508]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 906, 35, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [329, 364, 453, 634]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [53, 567, 67, 647]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 42, 38, 200]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 194, 38, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [557, 581, 578, 801]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then navigate the X to the bottom-right cell, by using the direction buttons.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 57: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[409,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \"task.html\" in the Downloads folder. The file item has a bounding box of `[282, 59, 537, 497]`. Tapping this should initiate opening the file, likely prompting for an app to open it with. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'task.html\\' at [409, 278] did not result in any observable change on the screen. The file \\'task.html\\' did not open, and no dialog (e.g., \\'Open with\\') appeared. Therefore, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The tap might not have registered correctly, or there might be an issue with how the system handles this file type without a default app or without showing a chooser.\\n Step 58: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[409,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \"task.html\" file, which is located at approximately [409, 278]. The file item has a bounding box of `[282, 59, 537, 497]`. This action is intended to bring up a context menu, which might contain options to open the file, such as \"Open\" or \"Open with\". Actual Outcome: The long press on `task.html` at [409, 278] successfully selected the file. This is evident from the blue checkmark next to `task.html` and the updated top bar showing \"1 selected\" along with share, delete, and more options icons. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as selecting the file is a necessary step to access options like \"Open\" or \"Open with\". The next step is to interact with the newly appeared options, specifically the three-dot menu.\\n Step 59: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (more options) located in the top right corner. The icon\\'s bounding box is `[66, 855, 94, 946]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 900] was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing several options for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This menu includes \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Open with\\' option is now accessible.\\n Step 60: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text has a bounding box of `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. Tapping this option should bring up a dialog asking which app to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at [134, 630] was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, prompting the user to choose an application to open \\'task.html\\'. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully completing Subgoal 2.\\n Step 61: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,125],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with a bounding box of `[859, 57, 945, 193]`. Tapping this should open the \\'task.html\\' file in the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at [902, 125] in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful in launching the Chrome browser. The screen changed to display the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' page. This page requires the user to \\'Accept & continue\\' before proceeding. The \\'task.html\\' file is not yet open. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, as Chrome is now the active application, but an intermediate step (accepting terms) is required before the file can be displayed.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 62: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[921,499],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button. The button is blue and located at the bottom of the screen. Its bounding box is `[899, 297, 944, 702]`. This action should dismiss the welcome screen and proceed to the main Chrome interface, hopefully loading \\'task.html\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open File Manager App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app (e.g., \\\\\"Files\\\\\") is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"},{\"VariableName\":\"XElementNavigationToBottomRightConfirmation\",\"Content\":\"\",\"Status\":\"This piece of information is sought. No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 900] was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing several options for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This menu includes \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Open with\\' option is now accessible.\\n Step 60: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text has a bounding box of `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. Tapping this option should bring up a dialog asking which app to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at [134, 630] was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, prompting the user to choose an application to open \\'task.html\\'. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully completing Subgoal 2.\\n Step 61: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,125],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with a bounding box of `[859, 57, 945, 193]`. Tapping this should open the \\'task.html\\' file in the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at [902, 125] in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful in launching the Chrome browser. The screen changed to display the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' page. This page requires the user to \\'Accept & continue\\' before proceeding. The \\'task.html\\' file is not yet open. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, as Chrome is now the active application, but an intermediate step (accepting terms) is required before the file can be displayed.\\n Step 62: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[921,499],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button. The button is blue and located at the bottom of the screen. Its bounding box is `[899, 297, 944, 702]`. This action should dismiss the welcome screen and proceed to the main Chrome interface, hopefully loading \\'task.html\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Accept & continue\\' at [921, 499] was successful. The \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen was dismissed, and a new screen titled \\'Turn on sync?\\' appeared. This screen presents two options: \\'No thanks\\' and \\'Add account\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by progressing through Chrome\\'s initial setup. The next step is to address the sync prompt to finally get to the \\'task.html\\' page.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'17.08\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [222, 36, 252, 381], \\'text\\': \\'Turn on sync?\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [270, 34, 332, 964], \\'text\\': \\'Sync your passwords, history & more on all devices Google may use your history to personalize Search and other Google services\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [368, 38, 390, 767], \\'text\\': \\'You can always choose what to sync in settings.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [922, 64, 937, 230], \\'text\\': \\'No thanks\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [921, 698, 937, 908], \\'text\\': \\'Add account\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [908, 638, 953, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [103, 329, 169, 535]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 819, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 36, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 141, 35, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 907, 36, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [80, 680, 169, 775]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then navigate the X to the bottom-right cell, by using the direction buttons.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 58: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[409,278],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the \"task.html\" file, which is located at approximately [409, 278]. The file item has a bounding box of `[282, 59, 537, 497]`. This action is intended to bring up a context menu, which might contain options to open the file, such as \"Open\" or \"Open with\". Actual Outcome: The long press on `task.html` at [409, 278] successfully selected the file. This is evident from the blue checkmark next to `task.html` and the updated top bar showing \"1 selected\" along with share, delete, and more options icons. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as selecting the file is a necessary step to access options like \"Open\" or \"Open with\". The next step is to interact with the newly appeared options, specifically the three-dot menu.\\n Step 59: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (more options) located in the top right corner. The icon\\'s bounding box is `[66, 855, 94, 946]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 900] was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing several options for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This menu includes \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Open with\\' option is now accessible.\\n Step 60: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text has a bounding box of `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. Tapping this option should bring up a dialog asking which app to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at [134, 630] was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, prompting the user to choose an application to open \\'task.html\\'. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully completing Subgoal 2.\\n Step 61: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with a bounding box of `[859, 57, 945, 193]`. Tapping this should open the \\'task.html\\' file in the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at [902, 125] in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful in launching the Chrome browser. The screen changed to display the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' page. This page requires the user to \\'Accept & continue\\' before proceeding. The \\'task.html\\' file is not yet open. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, as Chrome is now the active application, but an intermediate step (accepting terms) is required before the file can be displayed.\\n Step 62: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[921,499],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button. The button is blue and located at the bottom of the screen. Its bounding box is `[899, 297, 944, 702]`. This action should dismiss the welcome screen and proceed to the main Chrome interface, hopefully loading \\'task.html\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Accept & continue\\' at [921, 499] was successful. The \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen was dismissed, and a new screen titled \\'Turn on sync?\\' appeared. This screen presents two options: \\'No thanks\\' and \\'Add account\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by progressing through Chrome\\'s initial setup. The next step is to address the sync prompt to finally get to the \\'task.html\\' page.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 63: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then navigate the X to the bottom-right cell, by using the direction buttons.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 59: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (more options) located in the top right corner. The icon\\'s bounding box is `[66, 855, 94, 946]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open\\' or \\'Open with\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 900] was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing several options for the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This menu includes \\'Open with\\', \\'Sort by...\\', \\'Deselect all\\', \\'Copy to...\\', \\'Move to...\\', \\'Compress\\', \\'Rename\\', and \\'Get info\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the \\'Open with\\' option is now accessible.\\n Step 60: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text has a bounding box of `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. Tapping this option should bring up a dialog asking which app to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at [134, 630] was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, prompting the user to choose an application to open \\'task.html\\'. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully completing Subgoal 2.\\n Step 61: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,125],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with a bounding box of `[859, 57, 945, 193]`. Tapping this should open the \\'task.html\\' file in the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at [902, 125] in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful in launching the Chrome browser. The screen changed to display the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' page. This page requires the user to \\'Accept & continue\\' before proceeding. The \\'task.html\\' file is not yet open. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, as Chrome is now the active application, but an intermediate step (accepting terms) is required before the file can be displayed.\\n Step 62: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[921,499],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button. The button is blue and located at the bottom of the screen. Its bounding box is `[899, 297, 944, 702]`. This action should dismiss the welcome screen and proceed to the main Chrome interface, hopefully loading \\'task.html\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Accept & continue\\' at [921, 499] was successful. The \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen was dismissed, and a new screen titled \\'Turn on sync?\\' appeared. This screen presents two options: \\'No thanks\\' and \\'Add account\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by progressing through Chrome\\'s initial setup. The next step is to address the sync prompt to finally get to the \\'task.html\\' page.\\n Step 63: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button, which has a bounding box of `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at [930, 147] failed. The \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen is still visible, and no change occurred on the screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. The action needs to be retried.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 64: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button again. The button is located at the bottom-left of the screen, with text \\'No thanks\\' and a bounding box of `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. The tap will be at `[930, 147]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text has a bounding box of `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. Tapping this option should bring up a dialog asking which app to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at [134, 630] was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, prompting the user to choose an application to open \\'task.html\\'. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully completing Subgoal 2.\\n Step 61: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,125],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with a bounding box of `[859, 57, 945, 193]`. Tapping this should open the \\'task.html\\' file in the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at [902, 125] in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful in launching the Chrome browser. The screen changed to display the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' page. This page requires the user to \\'Accept & continue\\' before proceeding. The \\'task.html\\' file is not yet open. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, as Chrome is now the active application, but an intermediate step (accepting terms) is required before the file can be displayed.\\n Step 62: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[921,499],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button. The button is blue and located at the bottom of the screen. Its bounding box is `[899, 297, 944, 702]`. This action should dismiss the welcome screen and proceed to the main Chrome interface, hopefully loading \\'task.html\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Accept & continue\\' at [921, 499] was successful. The \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen was dismissed, and a new screen titled \\'Turn on sync?\\' appeared. This screen presents two options: \\'No thanks\\' and \\'Add account\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by progressing through Chrome\\'s initial setup. The next step is to address the sync prompt to finally get to the \\'task.html\\' page.\\n Step 63: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button, which has a bounding box of `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at [930, 147] failed. The \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen is still visible, and no change occurred on the screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. The action needs to be retried.\\n Step 64: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button again. The button is located at the bottom-left of the screen, with text \\'No thanks\\' and a bounding box of `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. The tap will be at `[930, 147]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at [930, 147] on Chrome\\'s \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen failed. Instead of dismissing the sync prompt and loading \\'task.html\\', the application switched from Chrome back to the Files app. The \\'Downloads\\' folder is displayed, and \\'task.html\\' is still selected. This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'17:09\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 91, 381], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0 dY: 0.0 selected\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 710, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [488, 175, 504, 326], \\'text\\': \\'task html\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 178, 524, 367], \\'text\\': \\'4.77 kB 17.03\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 546, 205, 781]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 313, 205, 533]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 795, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [476, 54, 534, 496]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 792, 94, 851]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [232, 841, 259, 923]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 855, 94, 946]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 40, 37, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 819, 42, 942]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

Then navigate the X to the bottom-right cell, by using the direction buttons.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 60: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' text has a bounding box of `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. Tapping this option should bring up a dialog asking which app to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at [134, 630] was successful. A dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen, prompting the user to choose an application to open \\'task.html\\'. The available options are \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the user instruction by successfully completing Subgoal 2.\\n Step 61: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,125],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with a bounding box of `[859, 57, 945, 193]`. Tapping this should open the \\'task.html\\' file in the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at [902, 125] in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful in launching the Chrome browser. The screen changed to display the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' page. This page requires the user to \\'Accept & continue\\' before proceeding. The \\'task.html\\' file is not yet open. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, as Chrome is now the active application, but an intermediate step (accepting terms) is required before the file can be displayed.\\n Step 62: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[921,499],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button. The button is blue and located at the bottom of the screen. Its bounding box is `[899, 297, 944, 702]`. This action should dismiss the welcome screen and proceed to the main Chrome interface, hopefully loading \\'task.html\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Accept & continue\\' at [921, 499] was successful. The \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen was dismissed, and a new screen titled \\'Turn on sync?\\' appeared. This screen presents two options: \\'No thanks\\' and \\'Add account\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by progressing through Chrome\\'s initial setup. The next step is to address the sync prompt to finally get to the \\'task.html\\' page.\\n Step 63: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button, which has a bounding box of `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at [930, 147] failed. The \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen is still visible, and no change occurred on the screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. The action needs to be retried.\\n Step 64: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button again. The button is located at the bottom-left of the screen, with text \\'No thanks\\' and a bounding box of `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. The tap will be at `[930, 147]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at [930, 147] on Chrome\\'s \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen failed. Instead of dismissing the sync prompt and loading \\'task.html\\', the application switched from Chrome back to the Files app. The \\'Downloads\\' folder is displayed, and \\'task.html\\' is still selected. This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 65: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (more options) located in the top right corner. The icon has a bounding box of `[66, 855, 94, 946]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open File Manager App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app (e.g., \\\\\"Files\\\\\") is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,125],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with a bounding box of `[859, 57, 945, 193]`. Tapping this should open the \\'task.html\\' file in the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at [902, 125] in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful in launching the Chrome browser. The screen changed to display the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' page. This page requires the user to \\'Accept & continue\\' before proceeding. The \\'task.html\\' file is not yet open. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, as Chrome is now the active application, but an intermediate step (accepting terms) is required before the file can be displayed.\\n Step 62: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[921,499],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button. The button is blue and located at the bottom of the screen. Its bounding box is `[899, 297, 944, 702]`. This action should dismiss the welcome screen and proceed to the main Chrome interface, hopefully loading \\'task.html\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Accept & continue\\' at [921, 499] was successful. The \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen was dismissed, and a new screen titled \\'Turn on sync?\\' appeared. This screen presents two options: \\'No thanks\\' and \\'Add account\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by progressing through Chrome\\'s initial setup. The next step is to address the sync prompt to finally get to the \\'task.html\\' page.\\n Step 63: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button, which has a bounding box of `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at [930, 147] failed. The \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen is still visible, and no change occurred on the screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. The action needs to be retried.\\n Step 64: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button again. The button is located at the bottom-left of the screen, with text \\'No thanks\\' and a bounding box of `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. The tap will be at `[930, 147]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at [930, 147] on Chrome\\'s \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen failed. Instead of dismissing the sync prompt and loading \\'task.html\\', the application switched from Chrome back to the Files app. The \\'Downloads\\' folder is displayed, and \\'task.html\\' is still selected. This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 65: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (more options) located in the top right corner. The icon has a bounding box of `[66, 855, 94, 946]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 900] was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing options related to the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows re-initiating the \\'Open with\\' process.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'17:10\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 90, 381], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0 dY: 0.0 selected\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 710, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 549, 144, 712], \\'text\\': \\'Open with\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 272], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [176, 549, 196, 672], \\'text\\': \\'Sort by.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [229, 549, 246, 737], \\'text\\': \\'Deselect all\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 57, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [284, 637, 298, 678], \\'text\\': \\'to.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [335, 552, 351, 684], \\'text\\': \\'Move to.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [386, 547, 407, 716], \\'text\\': \\'Compress\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [440, 550, 455, 683], \\'text\\': \\'Rename\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [488, 175, 504, 326], \\'text\\': \\'task html\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [492, 551, 508, 678], \\'text\\': \\'Get info\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 178, 524, 367], \\'text\\': \\'4.77 kB 17.03\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [280, 545, 302, 638], \\'text\\': \\'Copy\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [476, 50, 535, 493]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 855, 92, 972]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 314, 204, 520]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 193, 38, 244]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [108, 524, 157, 988]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 789, 93, 854]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 31, 38, 190]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [47, 116, 94, 393]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [159, 531, 213, 980]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then navigate the X to the bottom-right cell, by using the direction buttons.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 61: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,125],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom left of the screen, with a bounding box of `[859, 57, 945, 193]`. Tapping this should open the \\'task.html\\' file in the Chrome browser. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at [902, 125] in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful in launching the Chrome browser. The screen changed to display the \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' page. This page requires the user to \\'Accept & continue\\' before proceeding. The \\'task.html\\' file is not yet open. This action has brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, as Chrome is now the active application, but an intermediate step (accepting terms) is required before the file can be displayed.\\n Step 62: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[921,499],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button. The button is blue and located at the bottom of the screen. Its bounding box is `[899, 297, 944, 702]`. This action should dismiss the welcome screen and proceed to the main Chrome interface, hopefully loading \\'task.html\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Accept & continue\\' at [921, 499] was successful. The \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen was dismissed, and a new screen titled \\'Turn on sync?\\' appeared. This screen presents two options: \\'No thanks\\' and \\'Add account\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by progressing through Chrome\\'s initial setup. The next step is to address the sync prompt to finally get to the \\'task.html\\' page.\\n Step 63: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button, which has a bounding box of `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at [930, 147] failed. The \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen is still visible, and no change occurred on the screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. The action needs to be retried.\\n Step 64: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button again. The button is located at the bottom-left of the screen, with text \\'No thanks\\' and a bounding box of `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. The tap will be at `[930, 147]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at [930, 147] on Chrome\\'s \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen failed. Instead of dismissing the sync prompt and loading \\'task.html\\', the application switched from Chrome back to the Files app. The \\'Downloads\\' folder is displayed, and \\'task.html\\' is still selected. This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 65: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (more options) located in the top right corner. The icon has a bounding box of `[66, 855, 94, 946]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 900] was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing options related to the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows re-initiating the \\'Open with\\' process.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 66: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' option is the first item in the menu, located at the top of the menu with text \\'Open with\\' and bounding box `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. This action is expected to close the context menu and display a dialog asking which app to use to open the file. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open File Manager App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The File Manager app (e.g., \\\\\"Files\\\\\") is open and its main screen is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[921,499],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button. The button is blue and located at the bottom of the screen. Its bounding box is `[899, 297, 944, 702]`. This action should dismiss the welcome screen and proceed to the main Chrome interface, hopefully loading \\'task.html\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Accept & continue\\' at [921, 499] was successful. The \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen was dismissed, and a new screen titled \\'Turn on sync?\\' appeared. This screen presents two options: \\'No thanks\\' and \\'Add account\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by progressing through Chrome\\'s initial setup. The next step is to address the sync prompt to finally get to the \\'task.html\\' page.\\n Step 63: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button, which has a bounding box of `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at [930, 147] failed. The \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen is still visible, and no change occurred on the screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. The action needs to be retried.\\n Step 64: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button again. The button is located at the bottom-left of the screen, with text \\'No thanks\\' and a bounding box of `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. The tap will be at `[930, 147]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at [930, 147] on Chrome\\'s \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen failed. Instead of dismissing the sync prompt and loading \\'task.html\\', the application switched from Chrome back to the Files app. The \\'Downloads\\' folder is displayed, and \\'task.html\\' is still selected. This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 65: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (more options) located in the top right corner. The icon has a bounding box of `[66, 855, 94, 946]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 900] was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing options related to the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows re-initiating the \\'Open with\\' process.\\n Step 66: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' option is the first item in the menu, located at the top of the menu with text \\'Open with\\' and bounding box `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. This action is expected to close the context menu and display a dialog asking which app to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at [134, 630] was successful. The context menu that was previously visible closed, and a new dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen. This dialog provides options for opening the selected file (\\'task.html\\'), specifically listing \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to choose Chrome from these options.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'17:10\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'IXv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 205, 91, 379], \\'text\\': \\'selected\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 57, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [177, 149, 197, 271], \\'text\\': \\'Images\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 413, 193, 504], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 644, 193, 752], \\'text\\': \\'Videos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 894, 193, 1000], \\'text\\': \\'Docum\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [238, 55, 252, 310], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [488, 175, 504, 326], \\'text\\': \\'task html\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 179, 523, 367], \\'text\\': \\'4.77 kB 17.03\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 70, 942, 182], \\'text\\': \\'Chrome\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 287, 942, 469], \\'text\\': \\'HTML Viewer\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [928, 577, 942, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Markor\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 547, 205, 779]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 796, 205, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [167, 57, 205, 297]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 314, 205, 532]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [858, 556, 947, 694]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [859, 57, 945, 192]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [859, 308, 945, 446]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [225, 828, 271, 939]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 55, 145, 232]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [282, 59, 540, 489]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 820, 36, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 905, 35, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 197, 36, 240]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

Then navigate the X to the bottom-right cell, by using the direction buttons.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 62: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[921,499],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Accept & continue\\' button. The button is blue and located at the bottom of the screen. Its bounding box is `[899, 297, 944, 702]`. This action should dismiss the welcome screen and proceed to the main Chrome interface, hopefully loading \\'task.html\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Accept & continue\\' at [921, 499] was successful. The \\'Welcome to Chrome\\' screen was dismissed, and a new screen titled \\'Turn on sync?\\' appeared. This screen presents two options: \\'No thanks\\' and \\'Add account\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3 by progressing through Chrome\\'s initial setup. The next step is to address the sync prompt to finally get to the \\'task.html\\' page.\\n Step 63: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button, which has a bounding box of `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at [930, 147] failed. The \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen is still visible, and no change occurred on the screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. The action needs to be retried.\\n Step 64: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button again. The button is located at the bottom-left of the screen, with text \\'No thanks\\' and a bounding box of `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. The tap will be at `[930, 147]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at [930, 147] on Chrome\\'s \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen failed. Instead of dismissing the sync prompt and loading \\'task.html\\', the application switched from Chrome back to the Files app. The \\'Downloads\\' folder is displayed, and \\'task.html\\' is still selected. This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 65: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (more options) located in the top right corner. The icon has a bounding box of `[66, 855, 94, 946]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 900] was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing options related to the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows re-initiating the \\'Open with\\' process.\\n Step 66: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' option is the first item in the menu, located at the top of the menu with text \\'Open with\\' and bounding box `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. This action is expected to close the context menu and display a dialog asking which app to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at [134, 630] was successful. The context menu that was previously visible closed, and a new dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen. This dialog provides options for opening the selected file (\\'task.html\\'), specifically listing \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to choose Chrome from these options.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 67: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom-left of the screen, with a bounding box of `[859, 57, 945, 192]`. This action is expected to launch Chrome and open the \\'task.html\\' file.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button, which has a bounding box of `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at [930, 147] failed. The \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen is still visible, and no change occurred on the screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. The action needs to be retried.\\n Step 64: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button again. The button is located at the bottom-left of the screen, with text \\'No thanks\\' and a bounding box of `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. The tap will be at `[930, 147]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at [930, 147] on Chrome\\'s \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen failed. Instead of dismissing the sync prompt and loading \\'task.html\\', the application switched from Chrome back to the Files app. The \\'Downloads\\' folder is displayed, and \\'task.html\\' is still selected. This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 65: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (more options) located in the top right corner. The icon has a bounding box of `[66, 855, 94, 946]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 900] was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing options related to the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows re-initiating the \\'Open with\\' process.\\n Step 66: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' option is the first item in the menu, located at the top of the menu with text \\'Open with\\' and bounding box `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. This action is expected to close the context menu and display a dialog asking which app to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at [134, 630] was successful. The context menu that was previously visible closed, and a new dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen. This dialog provides options for opening the selected file (\\'task.html\\'), specifically listing \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to choose Chrome from these options.\\n Step 67: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom-left of the screen, with a bounding box of `[859, 57, 945, 192]`. This action is expected to launch Chrome and open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at [902, 124] in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. The \\'task.html\\' file opened, displaying a grid with an \\'X\\' and navigation buttons. This action completed Subgoal 3.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 133], \\'text\\': \\'17:11\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 148, 97, 755], \\'text\\': \\'6 content://com.android provider:\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [338, 37, 353, 80], \\'text\\': \\'Up\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [337, 144, 353, 229], \\'text\\': \\'Down\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [336, 291, 352, 353], \\'text\\': \\'Left\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [335, 413, 354, 496], \\'text\\': \\'Right\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 384, 362, 523]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 261, 361, 382]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [326, 110, 362, 259]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 795, 106, 873]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 6, 361, 111]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 114, 108, 204]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [272, 5, 325, 126]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 898, 104, 967]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 140, 37, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [272, 118, 325, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 819, 43, 901]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then navigate the X to the bottom-right cell, by using the direction buttons.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 63: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button, which has a bounding box of `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at [930, 147] failed. The \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen is still visible, and no change occurred on the screen. The agent is not closer to completing the active subgoal. The action needs to be retried.\\n Step 64: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button again. The button is located at the bottom-left of the screen, with text \\'No thanks\\' and a bounding box of `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. The tap will be at `[930, 147]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at [930, 147] on Chrome\\'s \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen failed. Instead of dismissing the sync prompt and loading \\'task.html\\', the application switched from Chrome back to the Files app. The \\'Downloads\\' folder is displayed, and \\'task.html\\' is still selected. This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 65: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (more options) located in the top right corner. The icon has a bounding box of `[66, 855, 94, 946]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 900] was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing options related to the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows re-initiating the \\'Open with\\' process.\\n Step 66: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' option is the first item in the menu, located at the top of the menu with text \\'Open with\\' and bounding box `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. This action is expected to close the context menu and display a dialog asking which app to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at [134, 630] was successful. The context menu that was previously visible closed, and a new dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen. This dialog provides options for opening the selected file (\\'task.html\\'), specifically listing \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to choose Chrome from these options.\\n Step 67: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom-left of the screen, with a bounding box of `[859, 57, 945, 192]`. This action is expected to launch Chrome and open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at [902, 124] in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. The \\'task.html\\' file opened, displaying a grid with an \\'X\\' and navigation buttons. This action completed Subgoal 3.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 68: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button again. The button is located at the bottom-left of the screen, with text \\'No thanks\\' and a bounding box of `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. The tap will be at `[930, 147]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at [930, 147] on Chrome\\'s \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen failed. Instead of dismissing the sync prompt and loading \\'task.html\\', the application switched from Chrome back to the Files app. The \\'Downloads\\' folder is displayed, and \\'task.html\\' is still selected. This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 65: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (more options) located in the top right corner. The icon has a bounding box of `[66, 855, 94, 946]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 900] was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing options related to the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows re-initiating the \\'Open with\\' process.\\n Step 66: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' option is the first item in the menu, located at the top of the menu with text \\'Open with\\' and bounding box `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. This action is expected to close the context menu and display a dialog asking which app to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at [134, 630] was successful. The context menu that was previously visible closed, and a new dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen. This dialog provides options for opening the selected file (\\'task.html\\'), specifically listing \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to choose Chrome from these options.\\n Step 67: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom-left of the screen, with a bounding box of `[859, 57, 945, 192]`. This action is expected to launch Chrome and open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at [902, 124] in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. The \\'task.html\\' file opened, displaying a grid with an \\'X\\' and navigation buttons. This action completed Subgoal 3.\\n Step 68: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 353, 229]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` did not result in any change on the screen. The \\'X\\' element remained in the top-left cell of the grid. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The \\'Down\\' button needs to be tapped again to attempt to move the \\'X\\' downwards.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 133], \\'text\\': \\'17:11\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 148, 97, 755], \\'text\\': \\'6 content://com.android provider:\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [338, 37, 353, 80], \\'text\\': \\'Up\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [337, 145, 352, 228], \\'text\\': \\'Down\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [336, 291, 352, 353], \\'text\\': \\'Left\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [335, 413, 354, 496], \\'text\\': \\'Right\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 384, 362, 523]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 261, 361, 382]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [326, 110, 362, 259]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 794, 106, 873]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 114, 108, 204]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 6, 361, 111]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [272, 5, 325, 126]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 898, 104, 967]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 140, 37, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [272, 118, 325, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 819, 43, 900]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Then navigate the X to the bottom-right cell, by using the direction buttons.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 64: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,147],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'No thanks\\' button again. The button is located at the bottom-left of the screen, with text \\'No thanks\\' and a bounding box of `[922, 64, 937, 230]`. The tap will be at `[930, 147]`. This action is expected to dismiss the \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen and proceed to load the \\'task.html\\' file in Chrome. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'No thanks\\' at [930, 147] on Chrome\\'s \\'Turn on sync?\\' screen failed. Instead of dismissing the sync prompt and loading \\'task.html\\', the application switched from Chrome back to the Files app. The \\'Downloads\\' folder is displayed, and \\'task.html\\' is still selected. This action moved the agent further away from completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 65: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,900],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon (more options) located in the top right corner. The icon has a bounding box of `[66, 855, 94, 946]`. This action is expected to open a context menu with options like \\'Open with\\', \\'Delete\\', etc. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 900] was successful. A context menu appeared on the screen, providing options related to the selected file (\\'task.html\\'). This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as it allows re-initiating the \\'Open with\\' process.\\n Step 66: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' option is the first item in the menu, located at the top of the menu with text \\'Open with\\' and bounding box `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. This action is expected to close the context menu and display a dialog asking which app to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at [134, 630] was successful. The context menu that was previously visible closed, and a new dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen. This dialog provides options for opening the selected file (\\'task.html\\'), specifically listing \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to choose Chrome from these options.\\n Step 67: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom-left of the screen, with a bounding box of `[859, 57, 945, 192]`. This action is expected to launch Chrome and open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at [902, 124] in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. The \\'task.html\\' file opened, displaying a grid with an \\'X\\' and navigation buttons. This action completed Subgoal 3.\\n Step 68: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 353, 229]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` did not result in any change on the screen. The \\'X\\' element remained in the top-left cell of the grid. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The \\'Down\\' button needs to be tapped again to attempt to move the \\'X\\' downwards.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 69: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 352, 228]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom-left of the screen, with a bounding box of `[859, 57, 945, 192]`. This action is expected to launch Chrome and open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at [902, 124] in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. The \\'task.html\\' file opened, displaying a grid with an \\'X\\' and navigation buttons. This action completed Subgoal 3.\\n Step 68: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 353, 229]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` did not result in any change on the screen. The \\'X\\' element remained in the top-left cell of the grid. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The \\'Down\\' button needs to be tapped again to attempt to move the \\'X\\' downwards.\\n Step 69: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 352, 228]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` was performed. However, comparing the screen before and after the action, the \\'X\\' element did not move from its position in the top-left cell of the grid. The screen content remained unchanged. This action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is the second consecutive failure for this specific \\'Down\\' tap. The \\'Down\\' button needs to be tapped again to attempt to move the \\'X\\' downwards.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 42, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'17:12\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 148, 97, 755], \\'text\\': \\'6 content://com.android provider:\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [338, 37, 353, 80], \\'text\\': \\'Up\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [337, 145, 352, 228], \\'text\\': \\'Down\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [336, 291, 352, 353], \\'text\\': \\'Left\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [335, 413, 354, 496], \\'text\\': \\'Right\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 384, 362, 523]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 261, 361, 382]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [326, 110, 362, 259]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 795, 106, 873]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 114, 108, 204]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 6, 361, 111]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [272, 5, 325, 126]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 898, 104, 967]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 141, 37, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [272, 118, 325, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 819, 43, 900]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'Open with\\' option is the first item in the menu, located at the top of the menu with text \\'Open with\\' and bounding box `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. This action is expected to close the context menu and display a dialog asking which app to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at [134, 630] was successful. The context menu that was previously visible closed, and a new dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen. This dialog provides options for opening the selected file (\\'task.html\\'), specifically listing \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to choose Chrome from these options.\\n Step 67: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom-left of the screen, with a bounding box of `[859, 57, 945, 192]`. This action is expected to launch Chrome and open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at [902, 124] in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. The \\'task.html\\' file opened, displaying a grid with an \\'X\\' and navigation buttons. This action completed Subgoal 3.\\n Step 68: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` did not result in any change on the screen. The \\'X\\' element remained in the top-left cell of the grid. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The \\'Down\\' button needs to be tapped again to attempt to move the \\'X\\' downwards.\\n Step 69: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 352, 228]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` was performed. However, comparing the screen before and after the action, the \\'X\\' element did not move from its position in the top-left cell of the grid. The screen content remained unchanged. This action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is the second consecutive failure for this specific \\'Down\\' tap. The \\'Down\\' button needs to be tapped again to attempt to move the \\'X\\' downwards.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 70: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The context menu that was previously visible closed, and a new dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen. This dialog provides options for opening the selected file (\\'task.html\\'), specifically listing \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'.

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 42, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'17:13\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 148, 97, 755], \\'text\\': \\'6 content://com.android provider:\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [338, 37, 353, 80], \\'text\\': \\'Up\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [337, 145, 352, 228], \\'text\\': \\'Down\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [336, 291, 352, 353], \\'text\\': \\'Left\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [335, 413, 354, 496], \\'text\\': \\'Right\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 384, 362, 523]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 261, 361, 382]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [326, 110, 362, 259]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 795, 106, 873]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 114, 108, 204]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 6, 361, 111]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 817, 38, 898]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [272, 5, 325, 126]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 899, 104, 967]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 902, 37, 947]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 141, 37, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [272, 118, 325, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 40, 38, 136]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,630],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Open with\\' option in the context menu. The \\'Open with\\' option is the first item in the menu, located at the top of the menu with text \\'Open with\\' and bounding box `[124, 549, 144, 712]`. This action is expected to close the context menu and display a dialog asking which app to use to open the file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Open with\\' at [134, 630] was successful. The context menu that was previously visible closed, and a new dialog appeared at the bottom of the screen. This dialog provides options for opening the selected file (\\'task.html\\'), specifically listing \\'Chrome\\', \\'HTML Viewer\\', and \\'Markor\\'. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to choose Chrome from these options.\\n Step 67: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[902,124],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Chrome\\' option in the \\'Open with\\' dialog. The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom-left of the screen, with a bounding box of `[859, 57, 945, 192]`. This action is expected to launch Chrome and open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at [902, 124] in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. The \\'task.html\\' file opened, displaying a grid with an \\'X\\' and navigation buttons. This action completed Subgoal 3.\\n Step 68: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 353, 229]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` did not result in any change on the screen. The \\'X\\' element remained in the top-left cell of the grid. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The \\'Down\\' button needs to be tapped again to attempt to move the \\'X\\' downwards.\\n Step 69: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 352, 228]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` was performed. However, comparing the screen before and after the action, the \\'X\\' element did not move from its position in the top-left cell of the grid. The screen content remained unchanged. This action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is the second consecutive failure for this specific \\'Down\\' tap. The \\'Down\\' button needs to be tapped again to attempt to move the \\'X\\' downwards.\\n Step 70: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 352, 228]`.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'17:14\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 148, 97, 755], \\'text\\': \\'6 content://com.android provider:\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [338, 37, 353, 80], \\'text\\': \\'Up\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [337, 144, 353, 229], \\'text\\': \\'Down\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [336, 291, 352, 353], \\'text\\': \\'Left\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [335, 413, 354, 496], \\'text\\': \\'Right\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 384, 362, 523]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 261, 361, 382]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [326, 110, 362, 259]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 794, 107, 873]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [327, 6, 361, 111]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 113, 107, 204]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 898, 105, 968]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [272, 5, 325, 126]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 141, 37, 187]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'Chrome\\' option is located at the bottom-left of the screen, with a bounding box of `[859, 57, 945, 192]`. This action is expected to launch Chrome and open the \\'task.html\\' file. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Chrome\\' at [902, 124] in the \\'Open with\\' dialog was successful. The \\'task.html\\' file opened, displaying a grid with an \\'X\\' and navigation buttons. This action completed Subgoal 3.\\n Step 68: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 353, 229]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` did not result in any change on the screen. The \\'X\\' element remained in the top-left cell of the grid. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The \\'Down\\' button needs to be tapped again to attempt to move the \\'X\\' downwards.\\n Step 69: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 352, 228]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` was performed. However, comparing the screen before and after the action, the \\'X\\' element did not move from its position in the top-left cell of the grid. The screen content remained unchanged. This action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is the second consecutive failure for this specific \\'Down\\' tap. The \\'Down\\' button needs to be tapped again to attempt to move the \\'X\\' downwards.\\n Step 70: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,186],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Down\\' button, which has text \\'Down\\' and bounding box `[337, 144, 352, 228]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid from (row 1, col 1) to (row 2, col 1). This is the third attempt for this specific move. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` for the third time was performed. However, comparing the screen before and after the action, the \\'X\\' element did not move from its position in the top-left cell of the grid. The screen content remained unchanged. This action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is the third consecutive failure for the \\'Down\\' tap. The interactivity of the buttons is now highly questionable.\\n Step 71: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[345,455],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Right\\' button, which has text \\'Right\\' and bounding box `[335, 413, 354, 496]`. This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell to the right in the grid, from (row 1, col 1) to (row 1, col 2). Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Right\\' button at `[345, 455]` was successful. The \\'X\\' element on the screen moved one cell to the right, from the top-left cell (row 1, column 1) to the cell (row 1, column 2).

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` did not result in any change on the screen. The \\'X\\' element remained in the top-left cell of the grid. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The \\'Down\\' button needs to be tapped again to attempt to move the \\'X\\' downwards.\\n Step 69: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` was performed. However, comparing the screen before and after the action, the \\'X\\' element did not move from its position in the top-left cell of the grid. The screen content remained unchanged. This action failed to bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. This is the second consecutive failure for this specific \\'Down\\' tap. The \\'Down\\' button needs to be tapped again to attempt to move the \\'X\\' downwards.\\n Step 70: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This action is expected to move the \\'X\\' one cell down in the grid from (row 1, col 1) to (row 2, col 1). This is the third attempt for this specific move. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Down\\' button at `[345, 186]` for the third time was performed. However, comparing the screen before and after the action, the \\'X\\' element did not move from its position in the top-left cell of the grid. The screen content remained unchanged.

When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
