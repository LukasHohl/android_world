Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Tip 18 suggests that 'Simple Pro' apps might have simpler names (e.g., 'Draw' for 'Simple Draw Pro'). This will be investigated. The actual app name found will be stored.\\n2.  **Create a New Drawing**: Once the app is open, a new drawing needs to be initiated. This usually involves tapping a '+' icon or a 'New' menu option, or the app might open to a new canvas by default. The method used will be recorded.\\n3.  **Save and Name the Drawing**: The drawing needs to be saved with the specific filename 'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final.png' in the 'Pictures' folder. This typically involves a 'Save' or 'Save As' dialog where the filename can be entered and the path can be navigated. The 'sdk_gphone_x86_64' storage area likely refers to the device's internal storage.

UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current screen is the home screen. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where I can then search for the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[605,610],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Draw\\' app icon, which is located in the app drawer. The icon is an orange circle with a white pencil. This action is expected to launch the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Draw\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Draw\\' application launched and opened directly to a new, blank canvas, ready for drawing or saving. This completes the first two subgoals. The agent is now ready to proceed with saving the drawing.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.35\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 698, 100, 787], \\'text\\': \\'M\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [133, 659, 169, 856], \\'text\\': \\'2 #\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 879, 176, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [859, 353, 946, 648]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 800, 112, 893]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 907, 110, 987]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [127, 659, 180, 758]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [127, 545, 176, 639]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 778, 181, 864]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 561, 111, 652]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 676, 111, 771]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 823, 38, 901]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Name it adipiscing_fair_jelly_final.png. Save it in the Pictures folder within the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 3 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where I can then search for the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[605,610],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Draw\\' app icon, which is located in the app drawer. The icon is an orange circle with a white pencil. This action is expected to launch the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Draw\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Draw\\' application launched and opened directly to a new, blank canvas, ready for drawing or saving. This completes the first two subgoals. The agent is now ready to proceed with saving the drawing.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,606],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located in the top toolbar. The icon is currently visible and tappable. This action is expected to open a save dialog or a menu with save options, allowing me to specify the filename and location. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the save icon was successful. It opened the \\'Save as\\' dialog, which is the expected behavior for initiating the save process. The dialog provides a field to enter the filename and select the file type. The agent is now closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the drawing. The next immediate step is to input the correct filename.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'image_2023_10_15_15_36_05\\' from the filename field. The filename field is currently focused and contains this text. This action will clear the field, allowing the new filename to be entered.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

The current screen is the home screen. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where I can then search for the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[605,610],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Draw\\' app icon, which is located in the app drawer. The icon is an orange circle with a white pencil. This action is expected to launch the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Draw\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Draw\\' application launched and opened directly to a new, blank canvas, ready for drawing or saving. This completes the first two subgoals. The agent is now ready to proceed with saving the drawing.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,606],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located in the top toolbar. The icon is currently visible and tappable. This action is expected to open a save dialog or a menu with save options, allowing me to specify the filename and location. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the save icon was successful. It opened the \\'Save as\\' dialog, which is the expected behavior for initiating the save process. The dialog provides a field to enter the filename and select the file type. The agent is now closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the drawing. The next immediate step is to input the correct filename.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'image_2023_10_15_15_36_05\\' from the filename field. The filename field is currently focused and contains this text. This action will clear the field, allowing the new filename to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused filename field was successful. The default filename \\'image_2023_10_15_15_36_05\\' has been removed, and the filename field is now empty, ready for the new filename to be entered. This action directly contributes to the progress of the active subgoal, which is to save the drawing with a specific name.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"Filename\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen.

Name it adipiscing_fair_jelly_final.png. Save it in the Pictures folder within the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 4 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where I can then search for the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[605,610],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Draw\\' app icon, which is located in the app drawer. The icon is an orange circle with a white pencil. This action is expected to launch the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Draw\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Draw\\' application launched and opened directly to a new, blank canvas, ready for drawing or saving. This completes the first two subgoals. The agent is now ready to proceed with saving the drawing.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,606],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located in the top toolbar. The icon is currently visible and tappable. This action is expected to open a save dialog or a menu with save options, allowing me to specify the filename and location. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the save icon was successful. It opened the \\'Save as\\' dialog, which is the expected behavior for initiating the save process. The dialog provides a field to enter the filename and select the file type. The agent is now closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the drawing. The next immediate step is to input the correct filename.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'image_2023_10_15_15_36_05\\' from the filename field. The filename field is currently focused and contains this text. This action will clear the field, allowing the new filename to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused filename field was successful. The default filename \\'image_2023_10_15_15_36_05\\' has been removed, and the filename field is now empty, ready for the new filename to be entered. This action directly contributes to the progress of the active subgoal, which is to save the drawing with a specific name.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' into the currently focused filename field. The filename field is currently empty. This action will populate the filename field with the desired name. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application (or its equivalent, e.g., \\'Draw\\') is open, and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

The current screen is the home screen. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where I can then search for the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[605,610],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Draw\\' app icon, which is located in the app drawer. The icon is an orange circle with a white pencil. This action is expected to launch the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Draw\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Draw\\' application launched and opened directly to a new, blank canvas, ready for drawing or saving. This completes the first two subgoals. The agent is now ready to proceed with saving the drawing.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,606],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located in the top toolbar. The icon is currently visible and tappable. This action is expected to open a save dialog or a menu with save options, allowing me to specify the filename and location. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the save icon was successful. It opened the \\'Save as\\' dialog, which is the expected behavior for initiating the save process. The dialog provides a field to enter the filename and select the file type. The agent is now closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the drawing. The next immediate step is to input the correct filename.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'image_2023_10_15_15_36_05\\' from the filename field. The filename field is currently focused and contains this text. This action will clear the field, allowing the new filename to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused filename field was successful. The default filename \\'image_2023_10_15_15_36_05\\' has been removed, and the filename field is now empty, ready for the new filename to be entered. This action directly contributes to the progress of the active subgoal, which is to save the drawing with a specific name.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' into the currently focused filename field. The filename field is currently empty. This action will populate the filename field with the desired name. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' into the filename field was successful. The text now appears in the \\'Filename\\' field as intended. The \\'Save as\\' dialog remains on screen, with the \\'.png\\' file type selected. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the drawing with the specified name and type.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 661, 169, 856], \\'text\\': \\'2 #\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 140, 353, 349], \\'text\\': \\'Save as\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [375, 161, 389, 291], \\'text\\': \\'Filename\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [399, 156, 427, 634], \\'text\\': \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [468, 198, 486, 273], \\'text\\': \\'.png\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [518, 200, 533, 269], \\'text\\': \\'Svg\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [564, 197, 583, 264], \\'text\\': \\'jpg\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [629, 543, 645, 657], \\'text\\': \\'Cancel\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [630, 757, 644, 808], \\'text\\': \\'OK\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [380, 117, 444, 881]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 878, 176, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [131, 662, 174, 756]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [131, 547, 173, 636]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [559, 134, 588, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [617, 707, 660, 849]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [130, 780, 174, 864]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [615, 493, 660, 707]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [463, 137, 485, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 804, 114, 891]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 912, 108, 983]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [508, 134, 545, 191]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\", resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.draw.pro:id/save_image_filename\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.simplemobiletools.draw.pro\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[133,911][947,1058]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider.

Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

Save it in the Pictures folder within the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom-middle of the screen to open the app drawer. The current screen is the home screen. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where I can then search for the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[605,610],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Draw\\' app icon, which is located in the app drawer. The icon is an orange circle with a white pencil. This action is expected to launch the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Draw\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Draw\\' application launched and opened directly to a new, blank canvas, ready for drawing or saving. This completes the first two subgoals. The agent is now ready to proceed with saving the drawing.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,606],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located in the top toolbar. The icon is currently visible and tappable. This action is expected to open a save dialog or a menu with save options, allowing me to specify the filename and location. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the save icon was successful. It opened the \\'Save as\\' dialog, which is the expected behavior for initiating the save process. The dialog provides a field to enter the filename and select the file type. The agent is now closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the drawing. The next immediate step is to input the correct filename.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'image_2023_10_15_15_36_05\\' from the filename field. The filename field is currently focused and contains this text. This action will clear the field, allowing the new filename to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused filename field was successful. The default filename \\'image_2023_10_15_15_36_05\\' has been removed, and the filename field is now empty, ready for the new filename to be entered. This action directly contributes to the progress of the active subgoal, which is to save the drawing with a specific name.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' into the currently focused filename field. The filename field is currently empty. This action will populate the filename field with the desired name. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' into the filename field was successful. The text now appears in the \\'Filename\\' field as intended. The \\'Save as\\' dialog remains on screen, with the \\'.png\\' file type selected. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the drawing with the specified name and type.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[637,782],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog. The \\'OK\\' button is located at the bottom right of the dialog. This action is expected to save the file with the specified name and type, and potentially navigate to a screen where the save path can be selected or confirm the save to a default location.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[605,610],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Draw\\' app icon, which is located in the app drawer. The icon is an orange circle with a white pencil. This action is expected to launch the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Draw\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Draw\\' application launched and opened directly to a new, blank canvas, ready for drawing or saving. This completes the first two subgoals. The agent is now ready to proceed with saving the drawing.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,606],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located in the top toolbar. The icon is currently visible and tappable. This action is expected to open a save dialog or a menu with save options, allowing me to specify the filename and location. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the save icon was successful. It opened the \\'Save as\\' dialog, which is the expected behavior for initiating the save process. The dialog provides a field to enter the filename and select the file type. The agent is now closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the drawing. The next immediate step is to input the correct filename.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'image_2023_10_15_15_36_05\\' from the filename field. The filename field is currently focused and contains this text. This action will clear the field, allowing the new filename to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused filename field was successful. The default filename \\'image_2023_10_15_15_36_05\\' has been removed, and the filename field is now empty, ready for the new filename to be entered. This action directly contributes to the progress of the active subgoal, which is to save the drawing with a specific name.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' into the currently focused filename field. The filename field is currently empty. This action will populate the filename field with the desired name. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' into the filename field was successful. The text now appears in the \\'Filename\\' field as intended. The \\'Save as\\' dialog remains on screen, with the \\'.png\\' file type selected. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the drawing with the specified name and type.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[637,782],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog. The \\'OK\\' button is located at the bottom right of the dialog. This action is expected to save the file with the specified name and type, and potentially navigate to a screen where the save path can be selected or confirm the save to a default location. Actual Outcome: Tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog successfully closed the dialog. It did not save the file directly but instead opened a new screen that appears to be a file browser interface, currently set to the \\'Downloads\\' directory. The filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final.png\\' is shown at the bottom with a \\'SAVE\\' button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal, as it has moved to the stage of selecting the save path. The next step is to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 175, 91, 425], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [186, 57, 200, 312], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [556, 417, 576, 583], \\'text\\': \\'No items\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [936, 178, 963, 743], \\'text\\': \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final:pnc\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [940, 811, 956, 910], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [372, 345, 476, 655]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [927, 750, 969, 969]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 193, 38, 245]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 785, 93, 860]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [933, 172, 966, 740]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [927, 10, 973, 123]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 24, 38, 196]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [10, 813, 41, 953]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [125, 55, 143, 233]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [46, 117, 96, 414]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Save it in the Pictures folder within the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[605,610],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Draw\\' app icon, which is located in the app drawer. The icon is an orange circle with a white pencil. This action is expected to launch the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Draw\\' app icon was successful. The \\'Draw\\' application launched and opened directly to a new, blank canvas, ready for drawing or saving. This completes the first two subgoals. The agent is now ready to proceed with saving the drawing.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[89,606],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk) located in the top toolbar. The icon is currently visible and tappable. This action is expected to open a save dialog or a menu with save options, allowing me to specify the filename and location. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the save icon was successful. It opened the \\'Save as\\' dialog, which is the expected behavior for initiating the save process. The dialog provides a field to enter the filename and select the file type. The agent is now closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the drawing. The next immediate step is to input the correct filename.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Deletes all text in the currently focused text field. If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'image_2023_10_15_15_36_05\\' from the filename field. The filename field is currently focused and contains this text. This action will clear the field, allowing the new filename to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused filename field was successful. The default filename \\'image_2023_10_15_15_36_05\\' has been removed, and the filename field is now empty, ready for the new filename to be entered. This action directly contributes to the progress of the active subgoal, which is to save the drawing with a specific name.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' into the currently focused filename field. The filename field is currently empty. This action will populate the filename field with the desired name. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' into the filename field was successful. The text now appears in the \\'Filename\\' field as intended. The \\'Save as\\' dialog remains on screen, with the \\'.png\\' file type selected. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the drawing with the specified name and type.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[637,782],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog. The \\'OK\\' button is located at the bottom right of the dialog. This action is expected to save the file with the specified name and type, and potentially navigate to a screen where the save path can be selected or confirm the save to a default location. Actual Outcome: Tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog successfully closed the dialog. It did not save the file directly but instead opened a new screen that appears to be a file browser interface, currently set to the \\'Downloads\\' directory. The filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final.png\\' is shown at the bottom with a \\'SAVE\\' button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal, as it has moved to the stage of selecting the save path. The next step is to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[77,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the top left of the screen (approximately [77, 65]). This action is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, allowing me to select a different storage location or navigate the file system. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application (or its equivalent, e.g., \\'Draw\\') is open, and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action directly contributes to the progress of the active subgoal, which is to save the drawing with a specific name.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' into the currently focused filename field. The filename field is currently empty. This action will populate the filename field with the desired name. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' into the filename field was successful. The text now appears in the \\'Filename\\' field as intended. The \\'Save as\\' dialog remains on screen, with the \\'.png\\' file type selected. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the drawing with the specified name and type.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[637,782],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog. The \\'OK\\' button is located at the bottom right of the dialog. This action is expected to save the file with the specified name and type, and potentially navigate to a screen where the save path can be selected or confirm the save to a default location. Actual Outcome: Tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog successfully closed the dialog. It did not save the file directly but instead opened a new screen that appears to be a file browser interface, currently set to the \\'Downloads\\' directory. The filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final.png\\' is shown at the bottom with a \\'SAVE\\' button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal, as it has moved to the stage of selecting the save path. The next step is to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[77,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the top left of the screen (approximately [77, 65]). This action is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, allowing me to select a different storage location or navigate the file system. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [77, 65] did not produce any visible change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' directory view remains, and no navigation menu appeared. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to selecting the \\'Pictures\\' folder. The agent needs to retry interacting with the hamburger menu or find an alternative way to navigate the file system.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 175, 91, 425], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [186, 57, 200, 312], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [556, 417, 576, 583], \\'text\\': \\'No items\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [936, 178, 963, 743], \\'text\\': \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final:pnc\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [940, 811, 956, 910], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [372, 345, 476, 655]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [927, 750, 969, 969]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 194, 38, 245]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [933, 172, 966, 740]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [927, 10, 973, 123]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 814, 41, 952]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 20, 38, 195]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 785, 94, 861]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [125, 55, 143, 233]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [46, 117, 96, 414]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The filename field is currently focused and contains this text. This action will clear the field, allowing the new filename to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused filename field was successful. The default filename \\'image_2023_10_15_15_36_05\\' has been removed, and the filename field is now empty, ready for the new filename to be entered. This action directly contributes to the progress of the active subgoal, which is to save the drawing with a specific name.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' into the currently focused filename field. The filename field is currently empty. This action will populate the filename field with the desired name. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' into the filename field was successful. The text now appears in the \\'Filename\\' field as intended. The \\'Save as\\' dialog remains on screen, with the \\'.png\\' file type selected. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the drawing with the specified name and type.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[637,782],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog. The \\'OK\\' button is located at the bottom right of the dialog. This action is expected to save the file with the specified name and type, and potentially navigate to a screen where the save path can be selected or confirm the save to a default location. Actual Outcome: Tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog successfully closed the dialog. It did not save the file directly but instead opened a new screen that appears to be a file browser interface, currently set to the \\'Downloads\\' directory. The filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final.png\\' is shown at the bottom with a \\'SAVE\\' button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal, as it has moved to the stage of selecting the save path. The next step is to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[77,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the top left of the screen (approximately [77, 65]). This action is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, allowing me to select a different storage location or navigate the file system. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [77, 65] did not produce any visible change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' directory view remains, and no navigation menu appeared. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to selecting the \\'Pictures\\' folder. The agent needs to retry interacting with the hamburger menu or find an alternative way to navigate the file system.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If there is no information, this action attempts to delete 100 characters.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Delete the current text \\'image_2023_10_15_15_36_05\\' from the filename field. The filename field is currently focused and contains this text. This action will clear the field, allowing the new filename to be entered. Actual Outcome: The action to delete all text in the focused filename field was successful. The default filename \\'image_2023_10_15_15_36_05\\' has been removed, and the filename field is now empty, ready for the new filename to be entered. This action directly contributes to the progress of the active subgoal, which is to save the drawing with a specific name.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' into the currently focused filename field. The filename field is currently empty. This action will populate the filename field with the desired name. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' into the filename field was successful. The text now appears in the \\'Filename\\' field as intended. The \\'Save as\\' dialog remains on screen, with the \\'.png\\' file type selected. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the drawing with the specified name and type.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[637,782],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog. The \\'OK\\' button is located at the bottom right of the dialog. This action is expected to save the file with the specified name and type, and potentially navigate to a screen where the save path can be selected or confirm the save to a default location. Actual Outcome: Tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog successfully closed the dialog. It did not save the file directly but instead opened a new screen that appears to be a file browser interface, currently set to the \\'Downloads\\' directory. The filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final.png\\' is shown at the bottom with a \\'SAVE\\' button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal, as it has moved to the stage of selecting the save path. The next step is to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[77,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the top left of the screen (approximately [77, 65]). This action is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, allowing me to select a different storage location or navigate the file system. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [77, 65] did not produce any visible change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' directory view remains, and no navigation menu appeared. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to selecting the \\'Pictures\\' folder. The agent needs to retry interacting with the hamburger menu or find an alternative way to navigate the file system.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,143],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Downloads\\' text located at approximately [134, 143] (center of the bounding box [126, 55, 142, 232]). This text represents the current directory. This action is an attempt to open a directory selection menu or navigate up the file system to change the save location from \\'Downloads\\' to \\'Pictures\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Downloads\\' text at [134, 143] failed to produce any change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' directory view remains, and no navigation menu or directory selection options appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. An alternative method for navigating the file system is required.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

The filename field is currently empty. This action will populate the filename field with the desired name. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' into the filename field was successful. The text now appears in the \\'Filename\\' field as intended. The \\'Save as\\' dialog remains on screen, with the \\'.png\\' file type selected. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the drawing with the specified name and type.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[637,782],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog. The \\'OK\\' button is located at the bottom right of the dialog. This action is expected to save the file with the specified name and type, and potentially navigate to a screen where the save path can be selected or confirm the save to a default location. Actual Outcome: Tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog successfully closed the dialog. It did not save the file directly but instead opened a new screen that appears to be a file browser interface, currently set to the \\'Downloads\\' directory. The filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final.png\\' is shown at the bottom with a \\'SAVE\\' button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal, as it has moved to the stage of selecting the save path. The next step is to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[77,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the top left of the screen (approximately [77, 65]). This action is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, allowing me to select a different storage location or navigate the file system. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [77, 65] did not produce any visible change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' directory view remains, and no navigation menu appeared. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to selecting the \\'Pictures\\' folder. The agent needs to retry interacting with the hamburger menu or find an alternative way to navigate the file system.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,143],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Downloads\\' text located at approximately [134, 143] (center of the bounding box [126, 55, 142, 232]). This text represents the current directory. This action is an attempt to open a directory selection menu or navigate up the file system to change the save location from \\'Downloads\\' to \\'Pictures\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Downloads\\' text at [134, 143] failed to produce any change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' directory view remains, and no navigation menu or directory selection options appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. An alternative method for navigating the file system is required.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,940],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximately [80, 940]). This action is expected to open a menu with options that might include navigating to different storage locations or changing the current directory from \\'Downloads\\' to \\'Pictures\\'. Actual Outcome: Tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 940] opened a context menu with options \"Sort by...\" and \"Show hidden files\". This menu does not provide options for navigating to a different directory, so the action did not help in reaching the \\'Pictures\\' folder. The agent is still in the \\'Downloads\\' directory view.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 175, 91, 425], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [125, 550, 144, 672], \\'text\\': \\'Sort by.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [176, 548, 194, 830], \\'text\\': \\'Show hidden files\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [186, 57, 200, 312], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [556, 417, 576, 583], \\'text\\': \\'No items\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [936, 178, 963, 743], \\'text\\': \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final:pnc\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [940, 811, 956, 910], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [373, 345, 476, 655]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [927, 750, 969, 969]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [161, 511, 213, 995]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 787, 91, 859]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 37, 244]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 869, 91, 976]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [927, 10, 973, 123]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [933, 172, 966, 740]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [107, 514, 160, 990]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 23, 38, 196]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 817, 38, 950]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12.

Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

Save it in the Pictures folder within the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' into the currently focused filename field. The filename field is currently empty. This action will populate the filename field with the desired name. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' into the filename field was successful. The text now appears in the \\'Filename\\' field as intended. The \\'Save as\\' dialog remains on screen, with the \\'.png\\' file type selected. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of saving the drawing with the specified name and type.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[637,782],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog. The \\'OK\\' button is located at the bottom right of the dialog. This action is expected to save the file with the specified name and type, and potentially navigate to a screen where the save path can be selected or confirm the save to a default location. Actual Outcome: Tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog successfully closed the dialog. It did not save the file directly but instead opened a new screen that appears to be a file browser interface, currently set to the \\'Downloads\\' directory. The filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final.png\\' is shown at the bottom with a \\'SAVE\\' button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal, as it has moved to the stage of selecting the save path. The next step is to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[77,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the top left of the screen (approximately [77, 65]). This action is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, allowing me to select a different storage location or navigate the file system. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [77, 65] did not produce any visible change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' directory view remains, and no navigation menu appeared. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to selecting the \\'Pictures\\' folder. The agent needs to retry interacting with the hamburger menu or find an alternative way to navigate the file system.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,143],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Downloads\\' text located at approximately [134, 143] (center of the bounding box [126, 55, 142, 232]). This text represents the current directory. This action is an attempt to open a directory selection menu or navigate up the file system to change the save location from \\'Downloads\\' to \\'Pictures\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Downloads\\' text at [134, 143] failed to produce any change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' directory view remains, and no navigation menu or directory selection options appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. An alternative method for navigating the file system is required.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,940],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximately [80, 940]). This action is expected to open a menu with options that might include navigating to different storage locations or changing the current directory from \\'Downloads\\' to \\'Pictures\\'. Actual Outcome: Tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 940] opened a context menu with options \"Sort by...\" and \"Show hidden files\". This menu does not provide options for navigating to a different directory, so the action did not help in reaching the \\'Pictures\\' folder. The agent is still in the \\'Downloads\\' directory view.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[193,185],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Files in Downloads\\' (center at [193, 185]) to close the currently open pop-up menu (\\'Sort by...\\', \\'Show hidden files\\'). This should return the screen to the standard file browser view for the \\'Downloads\\' folder, allowing further attempts to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[637,782],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog. The \\'OK\\' button is located at the bottom right of the dialog. This action is expected to save the file with the specified name and type, and potentially navigate to a screen where the save path can be selected or confirm the save to a default location. Actual Outcome: Tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog successfully closed the dialog. It did not save the file directly but instead opened a new screen that appears to be a file browser interface, currently set to the \\'Downloads\\' directory. The filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final.png\\' is shown at the bottom with a \\'SAVE\\' button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal, as it has moved to the stage of selecting the save path. The next step is to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[77,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the top left of the screen (approximately [77, 65]). This action is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, allowing me to select a different storage location or navigate the file system. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [77, 65] did not produce any visible change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' directory view remains, and no navigation menu appeared. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to selecting the \\'Pictures\\' folder. The agent needs to retry interacting with the hamburger menu or find an alternative way to navigate the file system.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,143],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Downloads\\' text located at approximately [134, 143] (center of the bounding box [126, 55, 142, 232]). This text represents the current directory. This action is an attempt to open a directory selection menu or navigate up the file system to change the save location from \\'Downloads\\' to \\'Pictures\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Downloads\\' text at [134, 143] failed to produce any change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' directory view remains, and no navigation menu or directory selection options appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. An alternative method for navigating the file system is required.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,940],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximately [80, 940]). This action is expected to open a menu with options that might include navigating to different storage locations or changing the current directory from \\'Downloads\\' to \\'Pictures\\'. Actual Outcome: Tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 940] opened a context menu with options \"Sort by...\" and \"Show hidden files\". This menu does not provide options for navigating to a different directory, so the action did not help in reaching the \\'Pictures\\' folder. The agent is still in the \\'Downloads\\' directory view.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[193,185],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Files in Downloads\\' (center at [193, 185]) to close the currently open pop-up menu (\\'Sort by...\\', \\'Show hidden files\\'). This should return the screen to the standard file browser view for the \\'Downloads\\' folder, allowing further attempts to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Files in Downloads\\' at [193, 185] successfully closed the pop-up menu that was showing \"Sort by...\" and \"Show hidden files\". The screen returned to the standard file browser view for the \\'Downloads\\' folder. This action was successful and allows the agent to continue attempting to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. It did not directly bring the agent closer to saving in the \\'Pictures\\' folder, but it cleared an obstacle (the pop-up menu) for further navigation attempts.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 175, 91, 425], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [186, 57, 200, 312], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [556, 417, 576, 583], \\'text\\': \\'No items\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [936, 178, 963, 743], \\'text\\': \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final:pnc\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [940, 811, 956, 910], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [372, 345, 476, 655]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [927, 750, 969, 969]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 194, 38, 245]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [933, 172, 966, 740]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [927, 10, 973, 123]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 785, 94, 861]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 22, 38, 195]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 813, 40, 953]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [125, 55, 143, 233]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [46, 117, 96, 414]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Save it in the Pictures folder within the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[637,782],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog. The \\'OK\\' button is located at the bottom right of the dialog. This action is expected to save the file with the specified name and type, and potentially navigate to a screen where the save path can be selected or confirm the save to a default location. Actual Outcome: Tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog successfully closed the dialog. It did not save the file directly but instead opened a new screen that appears to be a file browser interface, currently set to the \\'Downloads\\' directory. The filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final.png\\' is shown at the bottom with a \\'SAVE\\' button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal, as it has moved to the stage of selecting the save path. The next step is to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[77,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the top left of the screen (approximately [77, 65]). This action is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, allowing me to select a different storage location or navigate the file system. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [77, 65] did not produce any visible change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' directory view remains, and no navigation menu appeared. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to selecting the \\'Pictures\\' folder. The agent needs to retry interacting with the hamburger menu or find an alternative way to navigate the file system.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,143],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Downloads\\' text located at approximately [134, 143] (center of the bounding box [126, 55, 142, 232]). This text represents the current directory. This action is an attempt to open a directory selection menu or navigate up the file system to change the save location from \\'Downloads\\' to \\'Pictures\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Downloads\\' text at [134, 143] failed to produce any change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' directory view remains, and no navigation menu or directory selection options appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. An alternative method for navigating the file system is required.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,940],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximately [80, 940]). This action is expected to open a menu with options that might include navigating to different storage locations or changing the current directory from \\'Downloads\\' to \\'Pictures\\'. Actual Outcome: Tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 940] opened a context menu with options \"Sort by...\" and \"Show hidden files\". This menu does not provide options for navigating to a different directory, so the action did not help in reaching the \\'Pictures\\' folder. The agent is still in the \\'Downloads\\' directory view.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[193,185],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Files in Downloads\\' (center at [193, 185]) to close the currently open pop-up menu (\\'Sort by...\\', \\'Show hidden files\\'). This should return the screen to the standard file browser view for the \\'Downloads\\' folder, allowing further attempts to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Files in Downloads\\' at [193, 185] successfully closed the pop-up menu that was showing \"Sort by...\" and \"Show hidden files\". The screen returned to the standard file browser view for the \\'Downloads\\' folder. This action was successful and allows the agent to continue attempting to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. It did not directly bring the agent closer to saving in the \\'Pictures\\' folder, but it cleared an obstacle (the pop-up menu) for further navigation attempts.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Downloads\\' text in the title bar, located at approximately [80, 300] (center of bounding box [69, 175, 91, 425]). This action is intended to open a directory navigation menu or allow changing the current save path from \\'Downloads\\' to another location, hopefully leading to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application (or its equivalent, e.g., \\'Draw\\') is open, and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[77,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the top left of the screen (approximately [77, 65]). This action is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, allowing me to select a different storage location or navigate the file system. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [77, 65] did not produce any visible change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' directory view remains, and no navigation menu appeared. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to selecting the \\'Pictures\\' folder. The agent needs to retry interacting with the hamburger menu or find an alternative way to navigate the file system.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,143],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Downloads\\' text located at approximately [134, 143] (center of the bounding box [126, 55, 142, 232]). This text represents the current directory. This action is an attempt to open a directory selection menu or navigate up the file system to change the save location from \\'Downloads\\' to \\'Pictures\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Downloads\\' text at [134, 143] failed to produce any change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' directory view remains, and no navigation menu or directory selection options appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. An alternative method for navigating the file system is required.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,940],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximately [80, 940]). This action is expected to open a menu with options that might include navigating to different storage locations or changing the current directory from \\'Downloads\\' to \\'Pictures\\'. Actual Outcome: Tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 940] opened a context menu with options \"Sort by...\" and \"Show hidden files\". This menu does not provide options for navigating to a different directory, so the action did not help in reaching the \\'Pictures\\' folder. The agent is still in the \\'Downloads\\' directory view.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[193,185],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Files in Downloads\\' (center at [193, 185]) to close the currently open pop-up menu (\\'Sort by...\\', \\'Show hidden files\\'). This should return the screen to the standard file browser view for the \\'Downloads\\' folder, allowing further attempts to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Files in Downloads\\' at [193, 185] successfully closed the pop-up menu that was showing \"Sort by...\" and \"Show hidden files\". The screen returned to the standard file browser view for the \\'Downloads\\' folder. This action was successful and allows the agent to continue attempting to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. It did not directly bring the agent closer to saving in the \\'Pictures\\' folder, but it cleared an obstacle (the pop-up menu) for further navigation attempts.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Downloads\\' text in the title bar, located at approximately [80, 300] (center of bounding box [69, 175, 91, 425]). This action is intended to open a directory navigation menu or allow changing the current save path from \\'Downloads\\' to another location, hopefully leading to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Downloads\\' text in the title bar at [80, 300] (center of bounding box [69, 175, 91, 425]) was unsuccessful. No visual change occurred on the screen. The application remains in the \\'Downloads\\' directory view. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. An alternative method for navigating the file system is required.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 132], \\'text\\': \\'15.41\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 175, 91, 425], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [186, 57, 200, 312], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [556, 417, 576, 583], \\'text\\': \\'No items\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [936, 178, 963, 743], \\'text\\': \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final:pnc\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [940, 811, 956, 910], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [372, 345, 476, 655]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [927, 750, 969, 969]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 193, 38, 245]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [933, 172, 966, 740]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [927, 10, 973, 123]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 814, 41, 952]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 784, 94, 861]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 19, 38, 195]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [125, 55, 143, 233]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [46, 117, 96, 416]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Save it in the Pictures folder within the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[77,65],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the top left of the screen (approximately [77, 65]). This action is expected to open a navigation drawer or menu, allowing me to select a different storage location or navigate the file system. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [77, 65] did not produce any visible change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' directory view remains, and no navigation menu appeared. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to selecting the \\'Pictures\\' folder. The agent needs to retry interacting with the hamburger menu or find an alternative way to navigate the file system.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,143],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Downloads\\' text located at approximately [134, 143] (center of the bounding box [126, 55, 142, 232]). This text represents the current directory. This action is an attempt to open a directory selection menu or navigate up the file system to change the save location from \\'Downloads\\' to \\'Pictures\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Downloads\\' text at [134, 143] failed to produce any change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' directory view remains, and no navigation menu or directory selection options appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. An alternative method for navigating the file system is required.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,940],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximately [80, 940]). This action is expected to open a menu with options that might include navigating to different storage locations or changing the current directory from \\'Downloads\\' to \\'Pictures\\'. Actual Outcome: Tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 940] opened a context menu with options \"Sort by...\" and \"Show hidden files\". This menu does not provide options for navigating to a different directory, so the action did not help in reaching the \\'Pictures\\' folder. The agent is still in the \\'Downloads\\' directory view.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[193,185],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Files in Downloads\\' (center at [193, 185]) to close the currently open pop-up menu (\\'Sort by...\\', \\'Show hidden files\\'). This should return the screen to the standard file browser view for the \\'Downloads\\' folder, allowing further attempts to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Files in Downloads\\' at [193, 185] successfully closed the pop-up menu that was showing \"Sort by...\" and \"Show hidden files\". The screen returned to the standard file browser view for the \\'Downloads\\' folder. This action was successful and allows the agent to continue attempting to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. It did not directly bring the agent closer to saving in the \\'Pictures\\' folder, but it cleared an obstacle (the pop-up menu) for further navigation attempts.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Downloads\\' text in the title bar, located at approximately [80, 300] (center of bounding box [69, 175, 91, 425]). This action is intended to open a directory navigation menu or allow changing the current save path from \\'Downloads\\' to another location, hopefully leading to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Downloads\\' text in the title bar at [80, 300] (center of bounding box [69, 175, 91, 425]) was unsuccessful. No visual change occurred on the screen. The application remains in the \\'Downloads\\' directory view. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. An alternative method for navigating the file system is required.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,10],\"end_point\":[500,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe from the left edge of the screen (approximately [500, 10]) towards the right (to approximately [500, 300]). This action is intended to open a navigation drawer, which might provide options to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application (or its equivalent, e.g., \\'Draw\\') is open, and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[193,185],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Files in Downloads\\' (center at [193, 185]) to close the currently open pop-up menu (\\'Sort by...\\', \\'Show hidden files\\'). This should return the screen to the standard file browser view for the \\'Downloads\\' folder, allowing further attempts to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Files in Downloads\\' at [193, 185] successfully closed the pop-up menu that was showing \"Sort by...\" and \"Show hidden files\". The screen returned to the standard file browser view for the \\'Downloads\\' folder. This action was successful and allows the agent to continue attempting to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. It did not directly bring the agent closer to saving in the \\'Pictures\\' folder, but it cleared an obstacle (the pop-up menu) for further navigation attempts.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Downloads\\' text in the title bar, located at approximately [80, 300] (center of bounding box [69, 175, 91, 425]). This action is intended to open a directory navigation menu or allow changing the current save path from \\'Downloads\\' to another location, hopefully leading to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Downloads\\' text in the title bar at [80, 300] (center of bounding box [69, 175, 91, 425]) was unsuccessful. No visual change occurred on the screen. The application remains in the \\'Downloads\\' directory view. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. An alternative method for navigating the file system is required.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,10],\"end_point\":[500,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe from the left edge of the screen (approximately [500, 10]) towards the right (to approximately [500, 300]). This action is intended to open a navigation drawer, which might provide options to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500,10] to [500,300] failed to open a navigation drawer for directory selection. Instead, it unexpectedly closed the save file dialog and returned the application to the drawing canvas interface. This action moved the agent further away from the goal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. To get back on track, the agent needs to re-initiate the save process.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.42\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:1 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 231], \\'text\\': \\'X:/183.1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 392], \\'text\\': \\'Y: 1200.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 66, 533], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.313\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 670], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.001\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 798], \\'text\\': \\'Prs: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [75, 696, 100, 873], \\'text\\': \\'D <\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [133, 659, 169, 856], \\'text\\': \\'2 #\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 878, 176, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [129, 661, 175, 757]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [130, 546, 173, 637]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [128, 779, 178, 865]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 564, 110, 648]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 803, 112, 892]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 906, 111, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 193, 40, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [862, 350, 947, 647]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 144, 39, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 820, 39, 901]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 685, 105, 763]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a new drawing in Simple Draw Pro. Name it adipiscing_fair_jelly_final.png. Save it in the Pictures folder within the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[134,143],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Downloads\\' text located at approximately [134, 143] (center of the bounding box [126, 55, 142, 232]). This text represents the current directory. This action is an attempt to open a directory selection menu or navigate up the file system to change the save location from \\'Downloads\\' to \\'Pictures\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Downloads\\' text at [134, 143] failed to produce any change on the screen. The \\'Downloads\\' directory view remains, and no navigation menu or directory selection options appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. An alternative method for navigating the file system is required.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,940],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximately [80, 940]). This action is expected to open a menu with options that might include navigating to different storage locations or changing the current directory from \\'Downloads\\' to \\'Pictures\\'. Actual Outcome: Tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 940] opened a context menu with options \"Sort by...\" and \"Show hidden files\". This menu does not provide options for navigating to a different directory, so the action did not help in reaching the \\'Pictures\\' folder. The agent is still in the \\'Downloads\\' directory view.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[193,185],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Files in Downloads\\' (center at [193, 185]) to close the currently open pop-up menu (\\'Sort by...\\', \\'Show hidden files\\'). This should return the screen to the standard file browser view for the \\'Downloads\\' folder, allowing further attempts to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Files in Downloads\\' at [193, 185] successfully closed the pop-up menu that was showing \"Sort by...\" and \"Show hidden files\". The screen returned to the standard file browser view for the \\'Downloads\\' folder. This action was successful and allows the agent to continue attempting to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. It did not directly bring the agent closer to saving in the \\'Pictures\\' folder, but it cleared an obstacle (the pop-up menu) for further navigation attempts.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Downloads\\' text in the title bar, located at approximately [80, 300] (center of bounding box [69, 175, 91, 425]). This action is intended to open a directory navigation menu or allow changing the current save path from \\'Downloads\\' to another location, hopefully leading to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Downloads\\' text in the title bar at [80, 300] (center of bounding box [69, 175, 91, 425]) was unsuccessful. No visual change occurred on the screen. The application remains in the \\'Downloads\\' directory view. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. An alternative method for navigating the file system is required.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,10],\"end_point\":[500,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe from the left edge of the screen (approximately [500, 10]) towards the right (to approximately [500, 300]). This action is intended to open a navigation drawer, which might provide options to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500,10] to [500,300] failed to open a navigation drawer for directory selection. Instead, it unexpectedly closed the save file dialog and returned the application to the drawing canvas interface. This action moved the agent further away from the goal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. To get back on track, the agent needs to re-initiate the save process.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,606],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk symbol) located at the top of the screen, approximately at [90, 606]. This action is intended to reopen the \\'Save as\\' dialog, allowing another attempt to save the drawing with the specified filename and location. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application (or its equivalent, e.g., \\'Draw\\') is open, and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,940],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximately [80, 940]). This action is expected to open a menu with options that might include navigating to different storage locations or changing the current directory from \\'Downloads\\' to \\'Pictures\\'. Actual Outcome: Tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 940] opened a context menu with options \"Sort by...\" and \"Show hidden files\". This menu does not provide options for navigating to a different directory, so the action did not help in reaching the \\'Pictures\\' folder. The agent is still in the \\'Downloads\\' directory view.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[193,185],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Files in Downloads\\' (center at [193, 185]) to close the currently open pop-up menu (\\'Sort by...\\', \\'Show hidden files\\'). This should return the screen to the standard file browser view for the \\'Downloads\\' folder, allowing further attempts to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Files in Downloads\\' at [193, 185] successfully closed the pop-up menu that was showing \"Sort by...\" and \"Show hidden files\". The screen returned to the standard file browser view for the \\'Downloads\\' folder. This action was successful and allows the agent to continue attempting to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. It did not directly bring the agent closer to saving in the \\'Pictures\\' folder, but it cleared an obstacle (the pop-up menu) for further navigation attempts.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Downloads\\' text in the title bar, located at approximately [80, 300] (center of bounding box [69, 175, 91, 425]). This action is intended to open a directory navigation menu or allow changing the current save path from \\'Downloads\\' to another location, hopefully leading to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Downloads\\' text in the title bar at [80, 300] (center of bounding box [69, 175, 91, 425]) was unsuccessful. No visual change occurred on the screen. The application remains in the \\'Downloads\\' directory view. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. An alternative method for navigating the file system is required.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,10],\"end_point\":[500,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe from the left edge of the screen (approximately [500, 10]) towards the right (to approximately [500, 300]). This action is intended to open a navigation drawer, which might provide options to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500,10] to [500,300] failed to open a navigation drawer for directory selection. Instead, it unexpectedly closed the save file dialog and returned the application to the drawing canvas interface. This action moved the agent further away from the goal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. To get back on track, the agent needs to re-initiate the save process.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,606],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk symbol) located at the top of the screen, approximately at [90, 606]. This action is intended to reopen the \\'Save as\\' dialog, allowing another attempt to save the drawing with the specified filename and location. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the save icon at [90, 606] was successful. It reopened the \\'Save as\\' dialog. The dialog shows the filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' in the text field and the \\'.png\\' file type is selected. This action has brought the agent back to the point where it can attempt to save the file with the correct name and type, and then proceed to select the correct save location. This corrects the deviation caused by the previous swipe action.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.44\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [132, 661, 169, 856], \\'text\\': \\'2 #\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 140, 353, 349], \\'text\\': \\'Save as\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [375, 161, 389, 291], \\'text\\': \\'Filename\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [401, 156, 425, 631], \\'text\\': \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [468, 198, 486, 273], \\'text\\': \\'.png\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [518, 200, 533, 269], \\'text\\': \\'Svg\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [564, 197, 583, 264], \\'text\\': \\'jpg\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [629, 543, 645, 657], \\'text\\': \\'Cancel\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [630, 757, 644, 808], \\'text\\': \\'OK\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [380, 117, 444, 881]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 878, 176, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [131, 662, 174, 756]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [131, 547, 173, 636]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [559, 134, 588, 188]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [617, 708, 660, 848]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [130, 780, 174, 864]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [615, 493, 660, 707]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [463, 137, 485, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 804, 114, 891]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 913, 108, 983]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [508, 134, 544, 190]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"0\", text=\"adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\", resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.draw.pro:id/save_image_filename\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.simplemobiletools.draw.pro\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[133,911][947,1058]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### Screen Information Text After the Action ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Save it in the Pictures folder within the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,940],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen (approximately [80, 940]). This action is expected to open a menu with options that might include navigating to different storage locations or changing the current directory from \\'Downloads\\' to \\'Pictures\\'. Actual Outcome: Tapping the three-dot menu icon at [80, 940] opened a context menu with options \"Sort by...\" and \"Show hidden files\". This menu does not provide options for navigating to a different directory, so the action did not help in reaching the \\'Pictures\\' folder. The agent is still in the \\'Downloads\\' directory view.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[193,185],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Files in Downloads\\' (center at [193, 185]) to close the currently open pop-up menu (\\'Sort by...\\', \\'Show hidden files\\'). This should return the screen to the standard file browser view for the \\'Downloads\\' folder, allowing further attempts to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Files in Downloads\\' at [193, 185] successfully closed the pop-up menu that was showing \"Sort by...\" and \"Show hidden files\". The screen returned to the standard file browser view for the \\'Downloads\\' folder. This action was successful and allows the agent to continue attempting to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. It did not directly bring the agent closer to saving in the \\'Pictures\\' folder, but it cleared an obstacle (the pop-up menu) for further navigation attempts.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Downloads\\' text in the title bar, located at approximately [80, 300] (center of bounding box [69, 175, 91, 425]). This action is intended to open a directory navigation menu or allow changing the current save path from \\'Downloads\\' to another location, hopefully leading to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Downloads\\' text in the title bar at [80, 300] (center of bounding box [69, 175, 91, 425]) was unsuccessful. No visual change occurred on the screen. The application remains in the \\'Downloads\\' directory view. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. An alternative method for navigating the file system is required.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,10],\"end_point\":[500,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe from the left edge of the screen (approximately [500, 10]) towards the right (to approximately [500, 300]). This action is intended to open a navigation drawer, which might provide options to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500,10] to [500,300] failed to open a navigation drawer for directory selection. Instead, it unexpectedly closed the save file dialog and returned the application to the drawing canvas interface. This action moved the agent further away from the goal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. To get back on track, the agent needs to re-initiate the save process.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,606],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk symbol) located at the top of the screen, approximately at [90, 606]. This action is intended to reopen the \\'Save as\\' dialog, allowing another attempt to save the drawing with the specified filename and location. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the save icon at [90, 606] was successful. It reopened the \\'Save as\\' dialog. The dialog shows the filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' in the text field and the \\'.png\\' file type is selected. This action has brought the agent back to the point where it can attempt to save the file with the correct name and type, and then proceed to select the correct save location. This corrects the deviation caused by the previous swipe action.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 13: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[637,782],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately [637, 782]) in the \\'Save as\\' dialog. This action is expected to close the \\'Save as\\' dialog and open a file browser interface, likely defaulting to the \\'Downloads\\' folder, where the save location can be selected. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application (or its equivalent, e.g., \\'Draw\\') is open, and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[193,185],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Files in Downloads\\' (center at [193, 185]) to close the currently open pop-up menu (\\'Sort by...\\', \\'Show hidden files\\'). This should return the screen to the standard file browser view for the \\'Downloads\\' folder, allowing further attempts to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Files in Downloads\\' at [193, 185] successfully closed the pop-up menu that was showing \"Sort by...\" and \"Show hidden files\". The screen returned to the standard file browser view for the \\'Downloads\\' folder. This action was successful and allows the agent to continue attempting to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. It did not directly bring the agent closer to saving in the \\'Pictures\\' folder, but it cleared an obstacle (the pop-up menu) for further navigation attempts.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Downloads\\' text in the title bar, located at approximately [80, 300] (center of bounding box [69, 175, 91, 425]). This action is intended to open a directory navigation menu or allow changing the current save path from \\'Downloads\\' to another location, hopefully leading to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Downloads\\' text in the title bar at [80, 300] (center of bounding box [69, 175, 91, 425]) was unsuccessful. No visual change occurred on the screen. The application remains in the \\'Downloads\\' directory view. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. An alternative method for navigating the file system is required.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,10],\"end_point\":[500,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe from the left edge of the screen (approximately [500, 10]) towards the right (to approximately [500, 300]). This action is intended to open a navigation drawer, which might provide options to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500,10] to [500,300] failed to open a navigation drawer for directory selection. Instead, it unexpectedly closed the save file dialog and returned the application to the drawing canvas interface. This action moved the agent further away from the goal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. To get back on track, the agent needs to re-initiate the save process.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,606],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk symbol) located at the top of the screen, approximately at [90, 606]. This action is intended to reopen the \\'Save as\\' dialog, allowing another attempt to save the drawing with the specified filename and location. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the save icon at [90, 606] was successful. It reopened the \\'Save as\\' dialog. The dialog shows the filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' in the text field and the \\'.png\\' file type is selected. This action has brought the agent back to the point where it can attempt to save the file with the correct name and type, and then proceed to select the correct save location. This corrects the deviation caused by the previous swipe action.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[637,782],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately [637, 782]) in the \\'Save as\\' dialog. This action is expected to close the \\'Save as\\' dialog and open a file browser interface, likely defaulting to the \\'Downloads\\' folder, where the save location can be selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog was successful. It closed the \\'Save as\\' dialog and opened a file browser interface for selecting the save location. The interface currently shows the \\'Downloads\\' folder, and the filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final.png\\' is displayed at the bottom along with a \\'SAVE\\' button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by reaching the stage where the save location can be chosen.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.44\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 175, 91, 425], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [126, 55, 142, 232], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [186, 57, 200, 312], \\'text\\': \\'Files in Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [556, 417, 576, 583], \\'text\\': \\'No items\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [936, 178, 963, 743], \\'text\\': \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final:pnc\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [940, 811, 956, 910], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [372, 345, 476, 655]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [927, 750, 969, 969]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 194, 38, 245]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [933, 172, 966, 740]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [13, 24, 38, 195]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [927, 10, 973, 123]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 815, 40, 951]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 785, 94, 861]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [125, 55, 143, 233]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [46, 117, 96, 414]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Save it in the Pictures folder within the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[193,185],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Files in Downloads\\' (center at [193, 185]) to close the currently open pop-up menu (\\'Sort by...\\', \\'Show hidden files\\'). This should return the screen to the standard file browser view for the \\'Downloads\\' folder, allowing further attempts to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Files in Downloads\\' at [193, 185] successfully closed the pop-up menu that was showing \"Sort by...\" and \"Show hidden files\". The screen returned to the standard file browser view for the \\'Downloads\\' folder. This action was successful and allows the agent to continue attempting to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. It did not directly bring the agent closer to saving in the \\'Pictures\\' folder, but it cleared an obstacle (the pop-up menu) for further navigation attempts.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Downloads\\' text in the title bar, located at approximately [80, 300] (center of bounding box [69, 175, 91, 425]). This action is intended to open a directory navigation menu or allow changing the current save path from \\'Downloads\\' to another location, hopefully leading to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Downloads\\' text in the title bar at [80, 300] (center of bounding box [69, 175, 91, 425]) was unsuccessful. No visual change occurred on the screen. The application remains in the \\'Downloads\\' directory view. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. An alternative method for navigating the file system is required.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,10],\"end_point\":[500,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe from the left edge of the screen (approximately [500, 10]) towards the right (to approximately [500, 300]). This action is intended to open a navigation drawer, which might provide options to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500,10] to [500,300] failed to open a navigation drawer for directory selection. Instead, it unexpectedly closed the save file dialog and returned the application to the drawing canvas interface. This action moved the agent further away from the goal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. To get back on track, the agent needs to re-initiate the save process.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,606],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk symbol) located at the top of the screen, approximately at [90, 606]. This action is intended to reopen the \\'Save as\\' dialog, allowing another attempt to save the drawing with the specified filename and location. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the save icon at [90, 606] was successful. It reopened the \\'Save as\\' dialog. The dialog shows the filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' in the text field and the \\'.png\\' file type is selected. This action has brought the agent back to the point where it can attempt to save the file with the correct name and type, and then proceed to select the correct save location. This corrects the deviation caused by the previous swipe action.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[637,782],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately [637, 782]) in the \\'Save as\\' dialog. This action is expected to close the \\'Save as\\' dialog and open a file browser interface, likely defaulting to the \\'Downloads\\' folder, where the save location can be selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog was successful. It closed the \\'Save as\\' dialog and opened a file browser interface for selecting the save location. The interface currently shows the \\'Downloads\\' folder, and the filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final.png\\' is displayed at the bottom along with a \\'SAVE\\' button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by reaching the stage where the save location can be chosen.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 14: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[81,70],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon (center at approximately [81, 70]) located at the top left of the screen. This action is intended to open a navigation drawer, which should provide options to change the current directory from \\'Downloads\\' to \\'Pictures\\' or navigate to the internal storage. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application (or its equivalent, e.g., \\'Draw\\') is open, and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Several attempts to change the directory from \\'Downloads\\' failed: tapping the hamburger menu icon ([77, 65]), tapping the \\'Downloads\\' text ([134, 143]), tapping the three-dot menu icon ([80, 940] in the file browser) which only showed sort options, and tapping the \\'Downloads\\' text in the title bar ([80, 300]). An attempt to swipe from the left edge ([500,10] to [500,300]) to open a navigation drawer unexpectedly closed the save dialog and returned to the drawing canvas. The save icon was tapped again, and the \\'Save as\\' dialog reappeared with the filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' and \\'.png\\' selected. The \\'OK\\' button was tapped, and the app navigated to the file location selection screen, defaulting to \\'Downloads\\'. Tapped the hamburger menu icon at the top left (approximate center [81, 70]), which successfully opened a navigation drawer showing \\'Downloads\\', \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\', and \\'SDCARD\\'.\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[\"Tap on \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' (center at approximately [236, 331], bounding box [226, 150, 246, 512]) in the navigation drawer.\",\"Look for the \\'Pictures\\' folder in the \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' storage.\",\"Tap on the \\'Pictures\\' folder.\",\"Confirm that \\'Pictures\\' is the selected save location (e.g., the title bar or path display shows \\'Pictures\\').\",\"Tap the \\'SAVE\\' button (bottom right, text \\'SAVE\\' at [940, 811, 956, 910]) to finalize saving in the \\'Pictures\\' folder.\"],\"status\":\"in progress\"}],\"activeSubgoalId\":3}\\n\\n\\n\\n### Current Agent Memory ###\\n{\"memory\":[{\"VariableName\":\"SimpleDrawProAppName\",\"Content\":\"Draw\",\"Status\":\"A complete piece of information.\"},{\"VariableName\":\"NewDrawingCreationMethod\",\"Content\":\"app opened to new canvas by default\",\"Status\":\"A complete piece of information.\"},{\"VariableName\":\"FileNameInputMethod\",\"Content\":\"Delete default text in filename field, then input desired filename.\",\"Status\":\"A complete piece of information.\"},{\"VariableName\":\"SavePathSelectionMethod\",\"Content\":\"\",\"Status\":\"This piece of information is sought.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Downloads\\' text in the title bar, located at approximately [80, 300] (center of bounding box [69, 175, 91, 425]). This action is intended to open a directory navigation menu or allow changing the current save path from \\'Downloads\\' to another location, hopefully leading to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Downloads\\' text in the title bar at [80, 300] (center of bounding box [69, 175, 91, 425]) was unsuccessful. No visual change occurred on the screen. The application remains in the \\'Downloads\\' directory view. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. An alternative method for navigating the file system is required.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,10],\"end_point\":[500,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe from the left edge of the screen (approximately [500, 10]) towards the right (to approximately [500, 300]). This action is intended to open a navigation drawer, which might provide options to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500,10] to [500,300] failed to open a navigation drawer for directory selection. Instead, it unexpectedly closed the save file dialog and returned the application to the drawing canvas interface. This action moved the agent further away from the goal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. To get back on track, the agent needs to re-initiate the save process.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,606],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk symbol) located at the top of the screen, approximately at [90, 606]. This action is intended to reopen the \\'Save as\\' dialog, allowing another attempt to save the drawing with the specified filename and location. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the save icon at [90, 606] was successful. It reopened the \\'Save as\\' dialog. The dialog shows the filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' in the text field and the \\'.png\\' file type is selected. This action has brought the agent back to the point where it can attempt to save the file with the correct name and type, and then proceed to select the correct save location. This corrects the deviation caused by the previous swipe action.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[637,782],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately [637, 782]) in the \\'Save as\\' dialog. This action is expected to close the \\'Save as\\' dialog and open a file browser interface, likely defaulting to the \\'Downloads\\' folder, where the save location can be selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog was successful. It closed the \\'Save as\\' dialog and opened a file browser interface for selecting the save location. The interface currently shows the \\'Downloads\\' folder, and the filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final.png\\' is displayed at the bottom along with a \\'SAVE\\' button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by reaching the stage where the save location can be chosen.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[81,70],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon (center at approximately [81, 70]) located at the top left of the screen. This action is intended to open a navigation drawer, which should provide options to change the current directory from \\'Downloads\\' to \\'Pictures\\' or navigate to the internal storage. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [81, 70] was successful. It opened a navigation drawer on the left side of the screen. This drawer contains options for selecting the save location, including \\'Downloads\\', \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\', and \\'SDCARD\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing the means to navigate to the correct storage location.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.45\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 37, 93, 237], \\'text\\': \\'Save to\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [138, 153, 154, 330], \\'text\\': \\'Downloads\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [226, 150, 246, 512], \\'text\\': \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [293, 151, 308, 291], \\'text\\': \\'SDCARD\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [941, 675, 961, 740], \\'text\\': \\'pnc\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [940, 811, 956, 910], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [927, 749, 969, 967]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 38, 242]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [273, 25, 329, 543]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 177, 95, 237]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [283, 559, 320, 642]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Save it in the Pictures folder within the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[80,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Downloads\\' text in the title bar, located at approximately [80, 300] (center of bounding box [69, 175, 91, 425]). This action is intended to open a directory navigation menu or allow changing the current save path from \\'Downloads\\' to another location, hopefully leading to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Downloads\\' text in the title bar at [80, 300] (center of bounding box [69, 175, 91, 425]) was unsuccessful. No visual change occurred on the screen. The application remains in the \\'Downloads\\' directory view. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. An alternative method for navigating the file system is required.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,10],\"end_point\":[500,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe from the left edge of the screen (approximately [500, 10]) towards the right (to approximately [500, 300]). This action is intended to open a navigation drawer, which might provide options to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500,10] to [500,300] failed to open a navigation drawer for directory selection. Instead, it unexpectedly closed the save file dialog and returned the application to the drawing canvas interface. This action moved the agent further away from the goal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. To get back on track, the agent needs to re-initiate the save process.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,606],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk symbol) located at the top of the screen, approximately at [90, 606]. This action is intended to reopen the \\'Save as\\' dialog, allowing another attempt to save the drawing with the specified filename and location. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the save icon at [90, 606] was successful. It reopened the \\'Save as\\' dialog. The dialog shows the filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' in the text field and the \\'.png\\' file type is selected. This action has brought the agent back to the point where it can attempt to save the file with the correct name and type, and then proceed to select the correct save location. This corrects the deviation caused by the previous swipe action.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[637,782],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately [637, 782]) in the \\'Save as\\' dialog. This action is expected to close the \\'Save as\\' dialog and open a file browser interface, likely defaulting to the \\'Downloads\\' folder, where the save location can be selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog was successful. It closed the \\'Save as\\' dialog and opened a file browser interface for selecting the save location. The interface currently shows the \\'Downloads\\' folder, and the filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final.png\\' is displayed at the bottom along with a \\'SAVE\\' button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by reaching the stage where the save location can be chosen.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[81,70],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon (center at approximately [81, 70]) located at the top left of the screen. This action is intended to open a navigation drawer, which should provide options to change the current directory from \\'Downloads\\' to \\'Pictures\\' or navigate to the internal storage. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [81, 70] was successful. It opened a navigation drawer on the left side of the screen. This drawer contains options for selecting the save location, including \\'Downloads\\', \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\', and \\'SDCARD\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing the means to navigate to the correct storage location.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 15: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[236,331],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' in the navigation drawer. The text \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' is located at approximately [236, 331] (center of bounding box [226, 150, 246, 512]). This action is intended to select the \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' storage area and display its contents, allowing navigation to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application (or its equivalent, e.g., \\'Draw\\') is open, and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to reopen the \\'Save as\\' dialog, allowing another attempt to save the drawing with the specified filename and location. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the save icon at [90, 606] was successful. It reopened the \\'Save as\\' dialog. The dialog shows the filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' in the text field and the \\'.png\\' file type is selected. This action has brought the agent back to the point where it can attempt to save the file with the correct name and type, and then proceed to select the correct save location. This corrects the deviation caused by the previous swipe action.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[637,782],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately [637, 782]) in the \\'Save as\\' dialog. This action is expected to close the \\'Save as\\' dialog and open a file browser interface, likely defaulting to the \\'Downloads\\' folder, where the save location can be selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog was successful. It closed the \\'Save as\\' dialog and opened a file browser interface for selecting the save location. The interface currently shows the \\'Downloads\\' folder, and the filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final.png\\' is displayed at the bottom along with a \\'SAVE\\' button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by reaching the stage where the save location can be chosen.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[81,70],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon (center at approximately [81, 70]) located at the top left of the screen. This action is intended to open a navigation drawer, which should provide options to change the current directory from \\'Downloads\\' to \\'Pictures\\' or navigate to the internal storage. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [81, 70] was successful. It opened a navigation drawer on the left side of the screen. This drawer contains options for selecting the save location, including \\'Downloads\\', \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\', and \\'SDCARD\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing the means to navigate to the correct storage location.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[236,331],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' in the navigation drawer. The text \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' is located at approximately [236, 331] (center of bounding box [226, 150, 246, 512]). This action is intended to select the \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' storage area and display its contents, allowing navigation to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' in the navigation drawer was successful. The application navigated to the \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' storage area, displaying a list of its root folders (Alarms, Android, Audiobooks, DCIM, Documents, Download, Movies, Music, Notifications). The \\'Pictures\\' folder is not immediately visible in the current view, indicating that scrolling will be necessary to find it. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by selecting the correct storage area.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.46\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 97, 796], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0 dY: 0.0 Xv: 0.0 Yv: 0.0 JPrs: 0.0 sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 51, 145, 416], \\'text\\': \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [186, 57, 202, 473], \\'text\\': \\'Files on sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [257, 174, 274, 302], \\'text\\': \\'Alarms\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [337, 174, 354, 313], \\'text\\': \\'Android\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [417, 173, 434, 385], \\'text\\': \\'Audiobooks\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [497, 174, 514, 273], \\'text\\': \\'DCIM\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [577, 172, 594, 378], \\'text\\': \\'Documents\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [657, 174, 674, 352], \\'text\\': \\'Download\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [736, 175, 755, 305], \\'text\\': \\'Movies\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [817, 175, 834, 286], \\'text\\': \\'Music\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [896, 173, 915, 401], \\'text\\': \\'Notifications\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [936, 178, 963, 743], \\'text\\': \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final:pnc\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [940, 811, 956, 910], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [467, 170, 547, 986]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [927, 750, 969, 969]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [386, 169, 468, 987]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [546, 168, 627, 987]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [707, 169, 788, 987]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [307, 170, 389, 987]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 168, 708, 986]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 37, 245]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 27, 37, 190]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [927, 14, 973, 121]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 173, 870, 988]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 818, 40, 949]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [933, 178, 966, 746]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 861, 93, 982]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Save it in the Pictures folder within the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,10],\"end_point\":[500,300],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe from the left edge of the screen (approximately [500, 10]) towards the right (to approximately [500, 300]). This action is intended to open a navigation drawer, which might provide options to navigate to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500,10] to [500,300] failed to open a navigation drawer for directory selection. Instead, it unexpectedly closed the save file dialog and returned the application to the drawing canvas interface. This action moved the agent further away from the goal of saving the file in the \\'Pictures\\' folder. To get back on track, the agent needs to re-initiate the save process.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,606],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk symbol) located at the top of the screen, approximately at [90, 606]. This action is intended to reopen the \\'Save as\\' dialog, allowing another attempt to save the drawing with the specified filename and location. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the save icon at [90, 606] was successful. It reopened the \\'Save as\\' dialog. The dialog shows the filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' in the text field and the \\'.png\\' file type is selected. This action has brought the agent back to the point where it can attempt to save the file with the correct name and type, and then proceed to select the correct save location. This corrects the deviation caused by the previous swipe action.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[637,782],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately [637, 782]) in the \\'Save as\\' dialog. This action is expected to close the \\'Save as\\' dialog and open a file browser interface, likely defaulting to the \\'Downloads\\' folder, where the save location can be selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog was successful. It closed the \\'Save as\\' dialog and opened a file browser interface for selecting the save location. The interface currently shows the \\'Downloads\\' folder, and the filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final.png\\' is displayed at the bottom along with a \\'SAVE\\' button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by reaching the stage where the save location can be chosen.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[81,70],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon (center at approximately [81, 70]) located at the top left of the screen. This action is intended to open a navigation drawer, which should provide options to change the current directory from \\'Downloads\\' to \\'Pictures\\' or navigate to the internal storage. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [81, 70] was successful. It opened a navigation drawer on the left side of the screen. This drawer contains options for selecting the save location, including \\'Downloads\\', \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\', and \\'SDCARD\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing the means to navigate to the correct storage location.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[236,331],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' in the navigation drawer. The text \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' is located at approximately [236, 331] (center of bounding box [226, 150, 246, 512]). This action is intended to select the \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' storage area and display its contents, allowing navigation to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' in the navigation drawer was successful. The application navigated to the \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' storage area, displaying a list of its root folders (Alarms, Android, Audiobooks, DCIM, Documents, Download, Movies, Music, Notifications). The \\'Pictures\\' folder is not immediately visible in the current view, indicating that scrolling will be necessary to find it. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by selecting the correct storage area.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 16: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the list of folders. This action is intended to reveal the \\'Pictures\\' folder, which is currently not visible. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The \\'Simple Draw Pro\\' application (or its equivalent, e.g., \\'Draw\\') is open, and its main interface is visible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing the means to navigate to the correct storage location.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[236,331],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' in the navigation drawer. The text \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' is located at approximately [236, 331] (center of bounding box [226, 150, 246, 512]). This action is intended to select the \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' storage area and display its contents, allowing navigation to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' in the navigation drawer was successful. The application navigated to the \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' storage area, displaying a list of its root folders (Alarms, Android, Audiobooks, DCIM, Documents, Download, Movies, Music, Notifications). The \\'Pictures\\' folder is not immediately visible in the current view, indicating that scrolling will be necessary to find it. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by selecting the correct storage area.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the list of folders. This action is intended to reveal the \\'Pictures\\' folder, which is currently not visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders, revealing the \\'Pictures\\' folder. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by making the target folder visible and accessible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[90,606],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the save icon (floppy disk symbol) located at the top of the screen, approximately at [90, 606]. This action is intended to reopen the \\'Save as\\' dialog, allowing another attempt to save the drawing with the specified filename and location. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the save icon at [90, 606] was successful. It reopened the \\'Save as\\' dialog. The dialog shows the filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final\\' in the text field and the \\'.png\\' file type is selected. This action has brought the agent back to the point where it can attempt to save the file with the correct name and type, and then proceed to select the correct save location. This corrects the deviation caused by the previous swipe action.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[637,782],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately [637, 782]) in the \\'Save as\\' dialog. This action is expected to close the \\'Save as\\' dialog and open a file browser interface, likely defaulting to the \\'Downloads\\' folder, where the save location can be selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog was successful. It closed the \\'Save as\\' dialog and opened a file browser interface for selecting the save location. The interface currently shows the \\'Downloads\\' folder, and the filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final.png\\' is displayed at the bottom along with a \\'SAVE\\' button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by reaching the stage where the save location can be chosen.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[81,70],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon (center at approximately [81, 70]) located at the top left of the screen. This action is intended to open a navigation drawer, which should provide options to change the current directory from \\'Downloads\\' to \\'Pictures\\' or navigate to the internal storage. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [81, 70] was successful. It opened a navigation drawer on the left side of the screen. This drawer contains options for selecting the save location, including \\'Downloads\\', \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\', and \\'SDCARD\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing the means to navigate to the correct storage location.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[236,331],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' in the navigation drawer. The text \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' is located at approximately [236, 331] (center of bounding box [226, 150, 246, 512]). This action is intended to select the \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' storage area and display its contents, allowing navigation to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' in the navigation drawer was successful. The application navigated to the \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' storage area, displaying a list of its root folders (Alarms, Android, Audiobooks, DCIM, Documents, Download, Movies, Music, Notifications). The \\'Pictures\\' folder is not immediately visible in the current view, indicating that scrolling will be necessary to find it. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by selecting the correct storage area.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the list of folders. This action is intended to reveal the \\'Pictures\\' folder, which is currently not visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders, revealing the \\'Pictures\\' folder. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by making the target folder visible and accessible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 17: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[573,246],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Pictures\\' folder, which is visible on the screen at approximately [573, 246]. This action is expected to select the \\'Pictures\\' folder as the save location for the drawing.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Save it in the Pictures folder within the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[637,782],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'OK\\' button (center at approximately [637, 782]) in the \\'Save as\\' dialog. This action is expected to close the \\'Save as\\' dialog and open a file browser interface, likely defaulting to the \\'Downloads\\' folder, where the save location can be selected. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'OK\\' button in the \\'Save as\\' dialog was successful. It closed the \\'Save as\\' dialog and opened a file browser interface for selecting the save location. The interface currently shows the \\'Downloads\\' folder, and the filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final.png\\' is displayed at the bottom along with a \\'SAVE\\' button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by reaching the stage where the save location can be chosen.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[81,70],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon (center at approximately [81, 70]) located at the top left of the screen. This action is intended to open a navigation drawer, which should provide options to change the current directory from \\'Downloads\\' to \\'Pictures\\' or navigate to the internal storage. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [81, 70] was successful. It opened a navigation drawer on the left side of the screen. This drawer contains options for selecting the save location, including \\'Downloads\\', \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\', and \\'SDCARD\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by providing the means to navigate to the correct storage location.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[236,331],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' in the navigation drawer. The text \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' is located at approximately [236, 331] (center of bounding box [226, 150, 246, 512]). This action is intended to select the \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' storage area and display its contents, allowing navigation to the \\'Pictures\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' in the navigation drawer was successful. The application navigated to the \\'sdk_gphone64_x86_64\\' storage area, displaying a list of its root folders (Alarms, Android, Audiobooks, DCIM, Documents, Download, Movies, Music, Notifications). The \\'Pictures\\' folder is not immediately visible in the current view, indicating that scrolling will be necessary to find it. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by selecting the correct storage area.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the list of folders. This action is intended to reveal the \\'Pictures\\' folder, which is currently not visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders, revealing the \\'Pictures\\' folder. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by making the target folder visible and accessible.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[573,246],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Pictures\\' folder, which is visible on the screen at approximately [573, 246]. This action is expected to select the \\'Pictures\\' folder as the save location for the drawing. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Pictures\\' folder was successful. The application navigated into the \\'Pictures\\' folder, which is now the current directory for saving the file. The screen displays \\'No items\\' as expected for an empty folder. The filename \\'adipiscing_fair_jelly_final.png\\' and the \\'SAVE\\' button are still visible at the bottom. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by selecting the correct save location.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 18: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
