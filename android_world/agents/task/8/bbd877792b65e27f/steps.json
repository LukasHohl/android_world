Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

If the instruction involves exploration, include concrete subgoals to quantify the investigation steps. You are given a screenshot displaying the phone\\'s starting state.\\n\\nTo fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, you plan to add important text information to the agent\\'s memory. If required, explicitly mention adding and completing information to the agent memory in your plan.---\\nProvide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 96, 37, 319], \\'text\\': \\'SMS Messenger\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 233], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 82.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 396], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: -843.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'Prs: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'Size: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [92, 163, 108, 487], \\'text\\': \\'+13231466913 now\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [115, 162, 135, 813], \\'text\\': \\'Lunch meeting with Sarah at PM Cafe L\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [235, 160, 256, 254], \\'text\\': \\'Reply\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [236, 316, 252, 528], \\'text\\': \\'Mark as Read\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 336, 722, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Gmail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 561, 722, 675], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [704, 781, 722, 921], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [175, 199, 197, 288], \\'text\\': \\'Okay\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 294, 856, 467]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 68, 856, 237]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 764, 857, 930]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 535, 726, 689]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 530, 859, 705]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 299, 726, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 765, 726, 928]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [902, 704, 944, 788]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [903, 94, 946, 182]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 809, 949, 911]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [97, 862, 125, 924]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [233, 313, 255, 530]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to reveal more apps, hopefully including the \"SMS Messenger\" app. The current screen shows a list of apps in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards, revealing more applications. The \"SMS Messenger\" app (labeled as \"SMS Messe...\" with an orange icon) is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is the first step to locate and open the \"SMS Messenger\" app. The current screen is the home screen with a notification overlay. This action should reveal the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen with a notification to the app drawer, displaying a grid of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the apps accessible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower middle of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal more apps, hopefully including the \"SMS Messenger\" app. The current screen shows a list of apps in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards, revealing more applications. The \"SMS Messenger\" app (labeled as \"SMS Messe...\" with an orange icon) is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 2: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps.

This is the first step to locate and open the \"SMS Messenger\" app. The current screen is the home screen with a notification overlay. This action should reveal the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen with a notification to the app drawer, displaying a grid of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the apps accessible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower middle of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal more apps, hopefully including the \"SMS Messenger\" app. The current screen shows a list of apps in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards, revealing more applications. The \"SMS Messenger\" app (labeled as \"SMS Messe...\" with an orange icon) is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[818,159],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SMS Messe...\\' app icon (orange icon) located at approximately [818, 159] to open the Simple SMS Messenger app. The app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SMS Messe...\\' app icon was successful. The Simple SMS Messenger app opened, and its main screen is now displayed. This screen shows a list of existing messages and a \\'+\\' button in the bottom right, which is likely for composing a new message. The action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 200, 34, 240], \\'text\\': \\'=\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [79, 171, 99, 312], \\'text\\': \\'Search\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [145, 180, 210, 518], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \"+10787430639 Its a bird, it\\\\\\'s a plane. 15.34\"}\\', \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [253, 182, 318, 923], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \"+18407874306 Book club meets next Tuesday to discuss \\\\\\'198 15.34\"}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [360, 180, 426, 759], \\'text\\': \\'+11089888875 When in Rome, do as the Romans do. 15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [468, 180, 533, 742], \\'text\\': \\'+19420128998 Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. 15.34\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [576, 181, 642, 923], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \"+13231466913 Lunch meeting with Sarah at PM Cafe L\\\\\\'amo. 15.34\"}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [685, 182, 750, 596], \\'text\\': \\'+10283775093 Dont cry over spilled milk. 15.34\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [895, 819, 957, 967]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 752, 111, 838]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 633, 112, 726]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 859, 111, 939]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 142, 39, 186]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 246, 39, 296]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [562, 26, 666, 961]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 302, 40, 349]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 193, 39, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 816, 43, 951]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is the first step to locate and open the \"SMS Messenger\" app. The current screen is the home screen with a notification overlay. This action should reveal the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen with a notification to the app drawer, displaying a grid of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the apps accessible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower middle of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal more apps, hopefully including the \"SMS Messenger\" app. The current screen shows a list of apps in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards, revealing more applications. The \"SMS Messenger\" app (labeled as \"SMS Messe...\" with an orange icon) is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[818,159],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SMS Messe...\\' app icon (orange icon) located at approximately [818, 159] to open the Simple SMS Messenger app. The app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SMS Messe...\\' app icon was successful. The Simple SMS Messenger app opened, and its main screen is now displayed. This screen shows a list of existing messages and a \\'+\\' button in the bottom right, which is likely for composing a new message. The action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the blue \\'+\\' button located at approximately [926, 893] in the bottom right corner of the screen. This button is used to initiate a new SMS message. The current screen is the main screen of the SMS Messenger app. This action should open the screen for composing a new SMS message.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is the first step to locate and open the \"SMS Messenger\" app. The current screen is the home screen with a notification overlay. This action should reveal the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen with a notification to the app drawer, displaying a grid of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the apps accessible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower middle of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal more apps, hopefully including the \"SMS Messenger\" app. The current screen shows a list of apps in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards, revealing more applications. The \"SMS Messenger\" app (labeled as \"SMS Messe...\" with an orange icon) is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[818,159],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SMS Messe...\\' app icon (orange icon) located at approximately [818, 159] to open the Simple SMS Messenger app. The app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SMS Messe...\\' app icon was successful. The Simple SMS Messenger app opened, and its main screen is now displayed. This screen shows a list of existing messages and a \\'+\\' button in the bottom right, which is likely for composing a new message. The action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the blue \\'+\\' button located at approximately [926, 893] in the bottom right corner of the screen. This button is used to initiate a new SMS message. The current screen is the main screen of the SMS Messenger app. This action should open the screen for composing a new SMS message. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [926, 893] was successful. It transitioned the app from the main message list screen to the \\'New conversation\\' screen. This new screen contains a focused text field \\'Add Contact or Number...\\' for entering the recipient, and the virtual keyboard is active. This action directly achieved the objective of Subgoal 2, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The active Subgoal \\'Initiate a new SMS message\\' is now complete.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [79, 145, 101, 557], \\'text\\': \\'New conversation\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [140, 39, 160, 516], \\'text\\': \\'Add Contact or Number..\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [201, 79, 222, 117], \\'text\\': \\'H\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [190, 171, 236, 450], \\'text\\': \\'Hugo Pereira +13920741751\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 304, 37, 349]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 249, 37, 294]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 143, 37, 185]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [201, 926, 234, 995]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"2\", text=\"Add Contact or Number\u2026\", resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.smsmessenger:id/new_conversation_address\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.simplemobiletools.smsmessenger\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[42,296][1038,422]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Add Contact or Number\u2026\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"+18407874306\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text.

This is the first step to locate and open the \"SMS Messenger\" app. The current screen is the home screen with a notification overlay. This action should reveal the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen with a notification to the app drawer, displaying a grid of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the apps accessible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower middle of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal more apps, hopefully including the \"SMS Messenger\" app. The current screen shows a list of apps in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards, revealing more applications. The \"SMS Messenger\" app (labeled as \"SMS Messe...\" with an orange icon) is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This button is used to initiate a new SMS message. The current screen is the main screen of the SMS Messenger app. This action should open the screen for composing a new SMS message. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [926, 893] was successful. It transitioned the app from the main message list screen to the \\'New conversation\\' screen. This new screen contains a focused text field \\'Add Contact or Number...\\' for entering the recipient, and the virtual keyboard is active. This action directly achieved the objective of Subgoal 2, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [78, 142, 102, 558], \\'text\\': \\'New conversation\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [138, 35, 162, 336], \\'text\\': \\'+18407874306\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [201, 343, 220, 661], \\'text\\': \\'No contacts found\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 38, 238]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 143, 37, 184]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 250, 37, 293]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 305, 38, 349]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"2\", text=\"+18407874306\", resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.smsmessenger:id/new_conversation_address\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.simplemobiletools.smsmessenger\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[42,296][912,422]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"+18407874306\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is the first step to locate and open the \"SMS Messenger\" app. The current screen is the home screen with a notification overlay. This action should reveal the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen changed from the home screen with a notification to the app drawer, displaying a grid of installed applications. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the apps accessible.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the lower middle of the screen (from [900, 500] to [300, 500]) to scroll down the app drawer. This action is intended to reveal more apps, hopefully including the \"SMS Messenger\" app. The current screen shows a list of apps in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards, revealing more applications. The \"SMS Messenger\" app (labeled as \"SMS Messe...\" with an orange icon) is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[818,159],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SMS Messe...\\' app icon (orange icon) located at approximately [818, 159] to open the Simple SMS Messenger app. The app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SMS Messe...\\' app icon was successful. The Simple SMS Messenger app opened, and its main screen is now displayed. This screen shows a list of existing messages and a \\'+\\' button in the bottom right, which is likely for composing a new message. The action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the blue \\'+\\' button located at approximately [926, 893] in the bottom right corner of the screen. This button is used to initiate a new SMS message. The current screen is the main screen of the SMS Messenger app. This action should open the screen for composing a new SMS message. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [926, 893] was successful. It transitioned the app from the main message list screen to the \\'New conversation\\' screen. This new screen contains a focused text field \\'Add Contact or Number...\\' for entering the recipient, and the virtual keyboard is active. This action directly achieved the objective of Subgoal 2, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to reveal more apps, hopefully including the \"SMS Messenger\" app. The current screen shows a list of apps in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards, revealing more applications. The \"SMS Messenger\" app (labeled as \"SMS Messe...\" with an orange icon) is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[818,159],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SMS Messe...\\' app icon (orange icon) located at approximately [818, 159] to open the Simple SMS Messenger app. The app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SMS Messe...\\' app icon was successful. The Simple SMS Messenger app opened, and its main screen is now displayed. This screen shows a list of existing messages and a \\'+\\' button in the bottom right, which is likely for composing a new message. The action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the blue \\'+\\' button located at approximately [926, 893] in the bottom right corner of the screen. This button is used to initiate a new SMS message. The current screen is the main screen of the SMS Messenger app. This action should open the screen for composing a new SMS message. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [926, 893] was successful. It transitioned the app from the main message list screen to the \\'New conversation\\' screen. This new screen contains a focused text field \\'Add Contact or Number...\\' for entering the recipient, and the virtual keyboard is active. This action directly achieved the objective of Subgoal 2, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The active Subgoal \\'Initiate a new SMS message\\' is now complete.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"+18407874306\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the phone number \\'+18407874306\\' into the focused \\'Add Contact or Number...\\' text field. The text field currently displays \\'Add Contact or Number...\\'. After this action, it should contain \\'+18407874306\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'+18407874306\\' into the focused text field \\'Add Contact or Number...\\' was successful. The text field now correctly displays \\'+18407874306\\'. This completes the active Subgoal 3 \\'Enter the recipient\\'s phone number\\' and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[149,935],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon located at approximately [149, 935] to confirm the recipient and proceed to the message input screen. The checkmark icon is currently visible to the right of the entered phone number. This action should transition the screen to allow message input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the checkmark icon (predicted at [149, 935]) was successful. The application moved from the recipient entry screen to the conversation screen for the phone number \\'+18407874306\\'. A text input field labeled \\'Type a message...\\' is now visible at the bottom of the screen, ready for message composition. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of entering the message content.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [78, 140, 102, 497], \\'text\\': \\'+18407874306\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [813, 451, 831, 552], \\'text\\': \\'15.34\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [853, 180, 895, 718], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \"Book club meets next Tuesday to discuss \\\\\\'1984\\\\\\'.\"}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [940, 134, 960, 444], \\'text\\': \\'Type a message_\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [955, 900, 969, 967], \\'text\\': \\'SMS\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [866, 34, 913, 141]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [840, 149, 913, 785]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 679, 110, 775]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 303, 39, 348]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 249, 38, 295]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 143, 38, 185]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 195, 40, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 911, 109, 986]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 550, 110, 667]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 800, 112, 891]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [925, 886, 974, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [926, 24, 971, 119]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 823, 38, 902]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle.

If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to reveal more apps, hopefully including the \"SMS Messenger\" app. The current screen shows a list of apps in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer downwards, revealing more applications. The \"SMS Messenger\" app (labeled as \"SMS Messe...\" with an orange icon) is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[818,159],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SMS Messe...\\' app icon (orange icon) located at approximately [818, 159] to open the Simple SMS Messenger app. The app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SMS Messe...\\' app icon was successful. The Simple SMS Messenger app opened, and its main screen is now displayed. This screen shows a list of existing messages and a \\'+\\' button in the bottom right, which is likely for composing a new message. The action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the blue \\'+\\' button located at approximately [926, 893] in the bottom right corner of the screen. This button is used to initiate a new SMS message. The current screen is the main screen of the SMS Messenger app. This action should open the screen for composing a new SMS message. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [926, 893] was successful. It transitioned the app from the main message list screen to the \\'New conversation\\' screen. This new screen contains a focused text field \\'Add Contact or Number...\\' for entering the recipient, and the virtual keyboard is active. This action directly achieved the objective of Subgoal 2, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The active Subgoal \\'Initiate a new SMS message\\' is now complete.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"+18407874306\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the phone number \\'+18407874306\\' into the focused \\'Add Contact or Number...\\' text field. The text field currently displays \\'Add Contact or Number...\\'. After this action, it should contain \\'+18407874306\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'+18407874306\\' into the focused text field \\'Add Contact or Number...\\' was successful. The text field now correctly displays \\'+18407874306\\'. This completes the active Subgoal 3 \\'Enter the recipient\\'s phone number\\' and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[149,935],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon located at approximately [149, 935] to confirm the recipient and proceed to the message input screen. The checkmark icon is currently visible to the right of the entered phone number. This action should transition the screen to allow message input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the checkmark icon (predicted at [149, 935]) was successful. The application moved from the recipient entry screen to the conversation screen for the phone number \\'+18407874306\\'. A text input field labeled \\'Type a message...\\' is now visible at the bottom of the screen, ready for message composition. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of entering the message content.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[818,159],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SMS Messe...\\' app icon (orange icon) located at approximately [818, 159] to open the Simple SMS Messenger app. The app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SMS Messe...\\' app icon was successful. The Simple SMS Messenger app opened, and its main screen is now displayed. This screen shows a list of existing messages and a \\'+\\' button in the bottom right, which is likely for composing a new message. The action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the blue \\'+\\' button located at approximately [926, 893] in the bottom right corner of the screen. This button is used to initiate a new SMS message. The current screen is the main screen of the SMS Messenger app. This action should open the screen for composing a new SMS message. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [926, 893] was successful. It transitioned the app from the main message list screen to the \\'New conversation\\' screen. This new screen contains a focused text field \\'Add Contact or Number...\\' for entering the recipient, and the virtual keyboard is active. This action directly achieved the objective of Subgoal 2, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The active Subgoal \\'Initiate a new SMS message\\' is now complete.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"+18407874306\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the phone number \\'+18407874306\\' into the focused \\'Add Contact or Number...\\' text field. The text field currently displays \\'Add Contact or Number...\\'. After this action, it should contain \\'+18407874306\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'+18407874306\\' into the focused text field \\'Add Contact or Number...\\' was successful. The text field now correctly displays \\'+18407874306\\'. This completes the active Subgoal 3 \\'Enter the recipient\\'s phone number\\' and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[149,935],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon located at approximately [149, 935] to confirm the recipient and proceed to the message input screen. The checkmark icon is currently visible to the right of the entered phone number. This action should transition the screen to allow message input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the checkmark icon (predicted at [149, 935]) was successful. The application moved from the recipient entry screen to the conversation screen for the phone number \\'+18407874306\\'. A text input field labeled \\'Type a message...\\' is now visible at the bottom of the screen, ready for message composition. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of entering the message content.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[950,289],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Type a message...\\' text input field (bounding box [940, 134, 960, 444]) to activate it. The field is currently not focused. This action should bring up the keyboard and allow text input. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the \\'Type a message...\\' text field (predicted at [950, 289], actual bounding box [940, 134, 960, 444] from previous step, now identified as resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.smsmessenger:id/thread_type_message\", bounds=\"[148,2097][932,2223]\"), was successful. The tap activated the text field, causing the virtual keyboard to appear and the field to become focused. The screen now shows \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" and the text field \"Type a message\u2026\" is ready for input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of entering the message content. The next step is to input the required message.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [78, 140, 102, 497], \\'text\\': \\'+18407874306\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [766, 451, 783, 552], \\'text\\': \\'15.34\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [805, 180, 849, 717], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \"Book club meets next Tuesday to discuss \\\\\\'1984\\\\\\'\"}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [889, 129, 914, 428], \\'text\\': \\'fType a message.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [908, 900, 922, 967], \\'text\\': \\'SMS\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [793, 147, 865, 785]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [819, 34, 864, 140]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 680, 109, 773]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 303, 38, 348]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 916, 107, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [876, 890, 926, 979]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 249, 38, 294]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 144, 38, 186]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 39, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 803, 110, 887]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 550, 109, 666]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 31, 923, 110]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"10\", text=\"Type a message\u2026\", resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.smsmessenger:id/thread_type_message\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.simplemobiletools.smsmessenger\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[148,2097][932,2223]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Type a message\u2026\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[818,159],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SMS Messe...\\' app icon (orange icon) located at approximately [818, 159] to open the Simple SMS Messenger app. The app icon is currently visible in the app drawer. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SMS Messe...\\' app icon was successful. The Simple SMS Messenger app opened, and its main screen is now displayed. This screen shows a list of existing messages and a \\'+\\' button in the bottom right, which is likely for composing a new message. The action directly led to the completion of the active subgoal.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the blue \\'+\\' button located at approximately [926, 893] in the bottom right corner of the screen. This button is used to initiate a new SMS message. The current screen is the main screen of the SMS Messenger app. This action should open the screen for composing a new SMS message. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [926, 893] was successful. It transitioned the app from the main message list screen to the \\'New conversation\\' screen. This new screen contains a focused text field \\'Add Contact or Number...\\' for entering the recipient, and the virtual keyboard is active. This action directly achieved the objective of Subgoal 2, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The active Subgoal \\'Initiate a new SMS message\\' is now complete.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"+18407874306\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the phone number \\'+18407874306\\' into the focused \\'Add Contact or Number...\\' text field. The text field currently displays \\'Add Contact or Number...\\'. After this action, it should contain \\'+18407874306\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'+18407874306\\' into the focused text field \\'Add Contact or Number...\\' was successful. The text field now correctly displays \\'+18407874306\\'. This completes the active Subgoal 3 \\'Enter the recipient\\'s phone number\\' and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[149,935],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon located at approximately [149, 935] to confirm the recipient and proceed to the message input screen. The checkmark icon is currently visible to the right of the entered phone number. This action should transition the screen to allow message input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the checkmark icon (predicted at [149, 935]) was successful. The application moved from the recipient entry screen to the conversation screen for the phone number \\'+18407874306\\'. A text input field labeled \\'Type a message...\\' is now visible at the bottom of the screen, ready for message composition. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of entering the message content.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[950,289],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Type a message...\\' text input field (bounding box [940, 134, 960, 444]) to activate it. The field is currently not focused. This action should bring up the keyboard and allow text input. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the \\'Type a message...\\' text field (predicted at [950, 289], actual bounding box [940, 134, 960, 444] from previous step, now identified as resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.smsmessenger:id/thread_type_message\", bounds=\"[148,2097][932,2223]\"), was successful. The tap activated the text field, causing the virtual keyboard to appear and the field to become focused. The screen now shows \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" and the text field \"Type a message\u2026\" is ready for input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of entering the message content. The next step is to input the required message.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Yoga class every Tuesday and Thursday at 6 PM.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the message \\'Yoga class every Tuesday and Thursday at 6 PM.\\' into the focused \\'Type a message...\\' text field. The text field currently displays \\'Type a message...\\'. After this action, it should contain \\'Yoga class every Tuesday and Thursday at 6 PM.\\'.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the blue \\'+\\' button located at approximately [926, 893] in the bottom right corner of the screen. This button is used to initiate a new SMS message. The current screen is the main screen of the SMS Messenger app. This action should open the screen for composing a new SMS message. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [926, 893] was successful. It transitioned the app from the main message list screen to the \\'New conversation\\' screen. This new screen contains a focused text field \\'Add Contact or Number...\\' for entering the recipient, and the virtual keyboard is active. This action directly achieved the objective of Subgoal 2, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The active Subgoal \\'Initiate a new SMS message\\' is now complete.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"+18407874306\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the phone number \\'+18407874306\\' into the focused \\'Add Contact or Number...\\' text field. The text field currently displays \\'Add Contact or Number...\\'. After this action, it should contain \\'+18407874306\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'+18407874306\\' into the focused text field \\'Add Contact or Number...\\' was successful. The text field now correctly displays \\'+18407874306\\'. This completes the active Subgoal 3 \\'Enter the recipient\\'s phone number\\' and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[149,935],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon located at approximately [149, 935] to confirm the recipient and proceed to the message input screen. The checkmark icon is currently visible to the right of the entered phone number. This action should transition the screen to allow message input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the checkmark icon (predicted at [149, 935]) was successful. The application moved from the recipient entry screen to the conversation screen for the phone number \\'+18407874306\\'. A text input field labeled \\'Type a message...\\' is now visible at the bottom of the screen, ready for message composition. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of entering the message content.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[950,289],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Type a message...\\' text input field (bounding box [940, 134, 960, 444]) to activate it. The field is currently not focused. This action should bring up the keyboard and allow text input. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the \\'Type a message...\\' text field (predicted at [950, 289], actual bounding box [940, 134, 960, 444] from previous step, now identified as resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.smsmessenger:id/thread_type_message\", bounds=\"[148,2097][932,2223]\"), was successful. The tap activated the text field, causing the virtual keyboard to appear and the field to become focused. The screen now shows \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" and the text field \"Type a message\u2026\" is ready for input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of entering the message content. The next step is to input the required message.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Yoga class every Tuesday and Thursday at 6 PM.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the message \\'Yoga class every Tuesday and Thursday at 6 PM.\\' into the focused \\'Type a message...\\' text field. The text field currently displays \\'Type a message...\\'. After this action, it should contain \\'Yoga class every Tuesday and Thursday at 6 PM.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'Yoga class every Tuesday and Thursday at 6 PM.\\' into the focused text field was successful. The text field, which previously displayed \\'Type a message...\\', now correctly contains \\'Yoga class every Tuesday and Thursday at 6 PM.\\'. This is confirmed by the screenshot and the XML data for the text field. This action has completed the active subgoal of entering the message content, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction. The next step is to send the message.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [78, 140, 102, 497], \\'text\\': \\'+18407874306\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [766, 451, 783, 552], \\'text\\': \\'15.34\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [805, 180, 849, 717], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \"Book club meets next Tuesday to discuss \\\\\\'1984\\\\\\'\"}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [878, 130, 919, 831], \\'text\\': \\'Yoga class every Tuesday and Thursday at 6 PMI\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [908, 900, 922, 967], \\'text\\': \\'SMS\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 349, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [793, 146, 865, 785]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [819, 35, 864, 141]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 679, 110, 775]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [875, 892, 926, 976]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 913, 108, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 303, 39, 348]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 249, 38, 295]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 547, 109, 669]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 143, 39, 186]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 40, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 801, 111, 891]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"10\", text=\"Yoga class every Tuesday and Thursday at 6 PM.\", resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.smsmessenger:id/thread_type_message\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"com.simplemobiletools.smsmessenger\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[148,2097][932,2223]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Yoga class every Tuesday and Thursday at 6 PM.\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen.

If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[926,893],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the blue \\'+\\' button located at approximately [926, 893] in the bottom right corner of the screen. This button is used to initiate a new SMS message. The current screen is the main screen of the SMS Messenger app. This action should open the screen for composing a new SMS message. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'+\\' button at [926, 893] was successful. It transitioned the app from the main message list screen to the \\'New conversation\\' screen. This new screen contains a focused text field \\'Add Contact or Number...\\' for entering the recipient, and the virtual keyboard is active. This action directly achieved the objective of Subgoal 2, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s overall instruction. The active Subgoal \\'Initiate a new SMS message\\' is now complete.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"+18407874306\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the phone number \\'+18407874306\\' into the focused \\'Add Contact or Number...\\' text field. The text field currently displays \\'Add Contact or Number...\\'. After this action, it should contain \\'+18407874306\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'+18407874306\\' into the focused text field \\'Add Contact or Number...\\' was successful. The text field now correctly displays \\'+18407874306\\'. This completes the active Subgoal 3 \\'Enter the recipient\\'s phone number\\' and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[149,935],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkmark icon located at approximately [149, 935] to confirm the recipient and proceed to the message input screen. The checkmark icon is currently visible to the right of the entered phone number. This action should transition the screen to allow message input. Actual Outcome: The tap on the checkmark icon (predicted at [149, 935]) was successful. The application moved from the recipient entry screen to the conversation screen for the phone number \\'+18407874306\\'. A text input field labeled \\'Type a message...\\' is now visible at the bottom of the screen, ready for message composition. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of entering the message content.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[950,289],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Type a message...\\' text input field (bounding box [940, 134, 960, 444]) to activate it. The field is currently not focused. This action should bring up the keyboard and allow text input. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the \\'Type a message...\\' text field (predicted at [950, 289], actual bounding box [940, 134, 960, 444] from previous step, now identified as resource-id=\"com.simplemobiletools.smsmessenger:id/thread_type_message\", bounds=\"[148,2097][932,2223]\"), was successful. The tap activated the text field, causing the virtual keyboard to appear and the field to become focused. The screen now shows \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\" and the text field \"Type a message\u2026\" is ready for input. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of entering the message content. The next step is to input the required message.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Yoga class every Tuesday and Thursday at 6 PM.\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the message \\'Yoga class every Tuesday and Thursday at 6 PM.\\' into the focused \\'Type a message...\\' text field. The text field currently displays \\'Type a message...\\'. After this action, it should contain \\'Yoga class every Tuesday and Thursday at 6 PM.\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting the text \\'Yoga class every Tuesday and Thursday at 6 PM.\\' into the focused text field was successful. The text field, which previously displayed \\'Type a message...\\', now correctly contains \\'Yoga class every Tuesday and Thursday at 6 PM.\\'. This is confirmed by the screenshot and the XML data for the text field. This action has completed the active subgoal of entering the message content, bringing the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction. The next step is to send the message.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
