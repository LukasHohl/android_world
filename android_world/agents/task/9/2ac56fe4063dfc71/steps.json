Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the quick settings panel, which should contain the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the quick settings panel, but it appears to be only partially expanded. Quick setting toggles and notifications are now visible. However, the brightness slider, which is required for the completion of the current subgoal, is not visible. The action has brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal, but further action is needed. The next step should be to swipe down again to fully expand the quick settings panel.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the quick settings panel, which should contain the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the quick settings panel, but it appears to be only partially expanded. Quick setting toggles and notifications are now visible. However, the brightness slider, which is required for the completion of the current subgoal, is not visible. The action has brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal, but further action is needed. The next step should be to swipe down again to fully expand the quick settings panel.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 1: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[100,500],\"end_point\":[600,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from [100, 500] to [600, 500] to fully expand the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider, allowing the agent to proceed with setting the brightness to maximum. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Quick Settings Panel\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The quick settings panel is open and the brightness slider is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Swiped down once from the top of the screen.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

This action is expected to reveal the quick settings panel, which should contain the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the quick settings panel, but it appears to be only partially expanded. Quick setting toggles and notifications are now visible. However, the brightness slider, which is required for the completion of the current subgoal, is not visible. The action has brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal, but further action is needed. The next step should be to swipe down again to fully expand the quick settings panel.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[100,500],\"end_point\":[600,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from [100, 500] to [600, 500] to fully expand the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider, allowing the agent to proceed with setting the brightness to maximum. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully fully expanded the quick settings panel. More quick setting toggles are now visible. However, the brightness slider, which is required for the completion of the current subgoal, is not visible on this page. The action has brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by fully expanding the panel, but further action is needed to locate the brightness slider. The presence of three dots at the bottom of the panel indicates multiple pages, so the next step should be to swipe to another page.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 2: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,750],\"end_point\":[500,250],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [500, 750] to [500, 250] to navigate to the next page of the quick settings panel.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the quick settings panel, which should contain the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the quick settings panel, but it appears to be only partially expanded. Quick setting toggles and notifications are now visible. However, the brightness slider, which is required for the completion of the current subgoal, is not visible. The action has brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal, but further action is needed.

This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider, allowing the agent to proceed with setting the brightness to maximum. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully fully expanded the quick settings panel. More quick setting toggles are now visible. However, the brightness slider, which is required for the completion of the current subgoal, is not visible on this page. The action has brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by fully expanding the panel, but further action is needed to locate the brightness slider. The presence of three dots at the bottom of the panel indicates multiple pages, so the next step should be to swipe to another page.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,750],\"end_point\":[500,250],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [500, 750] to [500, 250] to navigate to the next page of the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully changed the page of the quick settings panel. The panel now displays different quick setting toggles. The highlighted dot at the bottom indicates that the agent is now on the second of three pages. The brightness slider is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by exploring another page of the quick settings, but the slider has not been found yet.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the quick settings panel, which should contain the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the quick settings panel, but it appears to be only partially expanded. Quick setting toggles and notifications are now visible. However, the brightness slider, which is required for the completion of the current subgoal, is not visible. The action has brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal, but further action is needed. The next step should be to swipe down again to fully expand the quick settings panel.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[100,500],\"end_point\":[600,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from [100, 500] to [600, 500] to fully expand the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider, allowing the agent to proceed with setting the brightness to maximum. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully fully expanded the quick settings panel. More quick setting toggles are now visible. However, the brightness slider, which is required for the completion of the current subgoal, is not visible on this page. The action has brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by fully expanding the panel, but further action is needed to locate the brightness slider. The presence of three dots at the bottom of the panel indicates multiple pages, so the next step should be to swipe to another page.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,750],\"end_point\":[500,250],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [500, 750] to [500, 250] to navigate to the next page of the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully changed the page of the quick settings panel. The panel now displays different quick setting toggles. The highlighted dot at the bottom indicates that the agent is now on the second of three pages. The brightness slider is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by exploring another page of the quick settings, but the slider has not been found yet.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,750],\"end_point\":[500,250],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [500, 750] to [500, 250] to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the quick settings panel, which should contain the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the quick settings panel, but it appears to be only partially expanded. Quick setting toggles and notifications are now visible. However, the brightness slider, which is required for the completion of the current subgoal, is not visible. The action has brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal, but further action is needed. The next step should be to swipe down again to fully expand the quick settings panel.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[100,500],\"end_point\":[600,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from [100, 500] to [600, 500] to fully expand the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider, allowing the agent to proceed with setting the brightness to maximum. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully fully expanded the quick settings panel. More quick setting toggles are now visible. However, the brightness slider, which is required for the completion of the current subgoal, is not visible on this page. The action has brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by fully expanding the panel, but further action is needed to locate the brightness slider. The presence of three dots at the bottom of the panel indicates multiple pages, so the next step should be to swipe to another page.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,750],\"end_point\":[500,250],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [500, 750] to [500, 250] to navigate to the next page of the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully changed the page of the quick settings panel. The panel now displays different quick setting toggles. The highlighted dot at the bottom indicates that the agent is now on the second of three pages. The brightness slider is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by exploring another page of the quick settings, but the slider has not been found yet.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,750],\"end_point\":[500,250],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [500, 750] to [500, 250] to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500, 750] to [500, 250] (right to left) was intended to navigate to the next page of the quick settings panel. However, the action failed to change the page. The device remains on the second of three pages, as indicated by the highlighted dot at the bottom of the screen. The brightness slider is still not visible. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,800],\"end_point\":[500,200],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [500, 800] to [500, 200] to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 98, 362], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 126480 IdY: 0.0 15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 426, 65, 537], \\'text\\': \\'Ixv: -0.648\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 813, 87, 956], \\'text\\': \\'T-Mobile\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [111, 35, 128, 219], \\'text\\': \\'Sun, Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [111, 874, 127, 965], \\'text\\': \\'100%\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [245, 148, 281, 333], \\'text\\': \\'Internet AndroidWifi\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [244, 618, 261, 775], \\'text\\': \\'Bluetooth\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [267, 620, 282, 667], \\'text\\': \\'On\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [340, 147, 378, 376], \\'text\\': \\'Flashlight Camera in use\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [340, 618, 377, 852], \\'text\\': \\'Do Not Disturb Off\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [438, 150, 452, 247], \\'text\\': \\'Alarm\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [436, 617, 474, 853], \\'text\\': \\'Airplane mode Off\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [458, 150, 474, 354], \\'text\\': \\'No alarm set\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [533, 148, 571, 393], \\'text\\': \\'Device controls Unavailable\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [534, 622, 549, 800], \\'text\\': \\'Auto-rotate\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [555, 620, 570, 667], \\'text\\': \\'On\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [220, 505, 307, 962]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [316, 505, 404, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [508, 502, 596, 971]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [412, 36, 502, 492]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [508, 33, 597, 493]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [316, 35, 403, 491]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [921, 861, 965, 966]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [921, 742, 966, 848]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [159, 867, 196, 938]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [65, 56, 101, 263]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [246, 398, 282, 475]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [106, 753, 131, 834]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [603, 847, 646, 949]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button.

Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

This action is expected to reveal the quick settings panel, which should contain the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the quick settings panel, but it appears to be only partially expanded. Quick setting toggles and notifications are now visible. However, the brightness slider, which is required for the completion of the current subgoal, is not visible. The action has brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal, but further action is needed. The next step should be to swipe down again to fully expand the quick settings panel.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[100,500],\"end_point\":[600,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from [100, 500] to [600, 500] to fully expand the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider, allowing the agent to proceed with setting the brightness to maximum. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully fully expanded the quick settings panel. More quick setting toggles are now visible. However, the brightness slider, which is required for the completion of the current subgoal, is not visible on this page. The action has brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by fully expanding the panel, but further action is needed to locate the brightness slider. The presence of three dots at the bottom of the panel indicates multiple pages, so the next step should be to swipe to another page.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,750],\"end_point\":[500,250],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [500, 750] to [500, 250] to navigate to the next page of the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully changed the page of the quick settings panel. The panel now displays different quick setting toggles. The highlighted dot at the bottom indicates that the agent is now on the second of three pages. The brightness slider is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by exploring another page of the quick settings, but the slider has not been found yet.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,750],\"end_point\":[500,250],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [500, 750] to [500, 250] to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500, 750] to [500, 250] (right to left) was intended to navigate to the next page of the quick settings panel. However, the action failed to change the page. The device remains on the second of three pages, as indicated by the highlighted dot at the bottom of the screen. The brightness slider is still not visible. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,800],\"end_point\":[500,200],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [500, 800] to [500, 200] to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500, 800] to [500, 200] (right to left) failed to change the page of the quick settings panel. The device remains on the second of three pages, and the brightness slider is still not visible. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[400,800],\"end_point\":[400,200],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [400, 800] to [400, 200] to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider, allowing the agent to proceed with setting the brightness to maximum. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully fully expanded the quick settings panel. More quick setting toggles are now visible. However, the brightness slider, which is required for the completion of the current subgoal, is not visible on this page. The action has brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by fully expanding the panel, but further action is needed to locate the brightness slider.

This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully changed the page of the quick settings panel. The panel now displays different quick setting toggles. The highlighted dot at the bottom indicates that the agent is now on the second of three pages. The brightness slider is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by exploring another page of the quick settings, but the slider has not been found yet.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,750],\"end_point\":[500,250],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [500, 750] to [500, 250] to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500, 750] to [500, 250] (right to left) was intended to navigate to the next page of the quick settings panel. However, the action failed to change the page. The device remains on the second of three pages, as indicated by the highlighted dot at the bottom of the screen. The brightness slider is still not visible.

As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider, allowing the agent to proceed with setting the brightness to maximum. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully fully expanded the quick settings panel. More quick setting toggles are now visible. However, the brightness slider, which is required for the completion of the current subgoal, is not visible on this page. The action has brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by fully expanding the panel, but further action is needed to locate the brightness slider. The presence of three dots at the bottom of the panel indicates multiple pages, so the next step should be to swipe to another page.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,750],\"end_point\":[500,250],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [500, 750] to [500, 250] to navigate to the next page of the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully changed the page of the quick settings panel. The panel now displays different quick setting toggles. The highlighted dot at the bottom indicates that the agent is now on the second of three pages. The brightness slider is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by exploring another page of the quick settings, but the slider has not been found yet.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,750],\"end_point\":[500,250],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [500, 750] to [500, 250] to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500, 750] to [500, 250] (right to left) was intended to navigate to the next page of the quick settings panel. However, the action failed to change the page. The device remains on the second of three pages, as indicated by the highlighted dot at the bottom of the screen. The brightness slider is still not visible. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,800],\"end_point\":[500,200],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [500, 800] to [500, 200] to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500, 800] to [500, 200] (right to left) failed to change the page of the quick settings panel. The device remains on the second of three pages, and the brightness slider is still not visible. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[400,800],\"end_point\":[400,200],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [400, 800] to [400, 200] to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [400, 800] to [400, 200] (right to left) was intended to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. However, the action failed. The screen content remained unchanged, and the device is still on the second of three pages. The brightness slider is not visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal. Since multiple swipe attempts to change the page have failed, the next step should be to try an alternative method, such as tapping the edit button in the quick settings panel.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[624,898],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the edit button (pencil icon) located at approximately [624, 898] to customize the quick settings panel. This action is expected to open a screen where the brightness slider can be added or made visible. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Quick Settings Panel\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The quick settings panel is open and the brightness slider is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Swiped down twice from the top of the screen.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully changed the page of the quick settings panel. The panel now displays different quick setting toggles. The highlighted dot at the bottom indicates that the agent is now on the second of three pages. The brightness slider is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by exploring another page of the quick settings, but the slider has not been found yet.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,750],\"end_point\":[500,250],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [500, 750] to [500, 250] to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500, 750] to [500, 250] (right to left) was intended to navigate to the next page of the quick settings panel. However, the action failed to change the page. The device remains on the second of three pages, as indicated by the highlighted dot at the bottom of the screen. The brightness slider is still not visible. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,800],\"end_point\":[500,200],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [500, 800] to [500, 200] to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500, 800] to [500, 200] (right to left) failed to change the page of the quick settings panel. The device remains on the second of three pages, and the brightness slider is still not visible. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[400,800],\"end_point\":[400,200],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [400, 800] to [400, 200] to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [400, 800] to [400, 200] (right to left) was intended to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. However, the action failed. The screen content remained unchanged, and the device is still on the second of three pages. The brightness slider is not visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal. Since multiple swipe attempts to change the page have failed, the next step should be to try an alternative method, such as tapping the edit button in the quick settings panel.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[624,898],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the edit button (pencil icon) located at approximately [624, 898] to customize the quick settings panel. This action is expected to open a screen where the brightness slider can be added or made visible. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the edit button (pencil icon) successfully navigated the agent to the \"Edit\" screen for quick settings tiles. The screen now displays \"Edit\" at the top and \"Hold and drag to rearrange tiles\". Various quick setting tiles are shown, and it\\'s possible to scroll to see more. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the customization options for the quick settings panel. The brightness slider is not yet visible, so further exploration of this screen is needed.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully changed the page of the quick settings panel. The panel now displays different quick setting toggles. The highlighted dot at the bottom indicates that the agent is now on the second of three pages. The brightness slider is still not visible. The action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by exploring another page of the quick settings, but the slider has not been found yet.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,750],\"end_point\":[500,250],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [500, 750] to [500, 250] to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500, 750] to [500, 250] (right to left) was intended to navigate to the next page of the quick settings panel. However, the action failed to change the page. The device remains on the second of three pages, as indicated by the highlighted dot at the bottom of the screen. The brightness slider is still not visible. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,800],\"end_point\":[500,200],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [500, 800] to [500, 200] to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500, 800] to [500, 200] (right to left) failed to change the page of the quick settings panel. The device remains on the second of three pages, and the brightness slider is still not visible. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[400,800],\"end_point\":[400,200],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [400, 800] to [400, 200] to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [400, 800] to [400, 200] (right to left) was intended to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. However, the action failed. The screen content remained unchanged, and the device is still on the second of three pages. The brightness slider is not visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal. Since multiple swipe attempts to change the page have failed, the next step should be to try an alternative method, such as tapping the edit button in the quick settings panel.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[624,898],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the edit button (pencil icon) located at approximately [624, 898] to customize the quick settings panel. This action is expected to open a screen where the brightness slider can be added or made visible. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the edit button (pencil icon) successfully navigated the agent to the \"Edit\" screen for quick settings tiles. The screen now displays \"Edit\" at the top and \"Hold and drag to rearrange tiles\". Various quick setting tiles are shown, and it\\'s possible to scroll to see more. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the customization options for the quick settings panel. The brightness slider is not yet visible, so further exploration of this screen is needed.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of quick settings tiles on the \"Edit\" screen. This action is expected to reveal more tiles, potentially including the brightness slider or an option to add it.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500, 750] to [500, 250] (right to left) was intended to navigate to the next page of the quick settings panel. However, the action failed to change the page. The device remains on the second of three pages, as indicated by the highlighted dot at the bottom of the screen. The brightness slider is still not visible. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,800],\"end_point\":[500,200],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [500, 800] to [500, 200] to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500, 800] to [500, 200] (right to left) failed to change the page of the quick settings panel. The device remains on the second of three pages, and the brightness slider is still not visible. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[400,800],\"end_point\":[400,200],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [400, 800] to [400, 200] to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [400, 800] to [400, 200] (right to left) was intended to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. However, the action failed. The screen content remained unchanged, and the device is still on the second of three pages. The brightness slider is not visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal. Since multiple swipe attempts to change the page have failed, the next step should be to try an alternative method, such as tapping the edit button in the quick settings panel.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[624,898],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the edit button (pencil icon) located at approximately [624, 898] to customize the quick settings panel. This action is expected to open a screen where the brightness slider can be added or made visible. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the edit button (pencil icon) successfully navigated the agent to the \"Edit\" screen for quick settings tiles. The screen now displays \"Edit\" at the top and \"Hold and drag to rearrange tiles\". Various quick setting tiles are shown, and it\\'s possible to scroll to see more. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the customization options for the quick settings panel. The brightness slider is not yet visible, so further exploration of this screen is needed.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of quick settings tiles on the \"Edit\" screen. This action is expected to reveal more tiles, potentially including the brightness slider or an option to add it. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [200, 500] successfully scrolled the content on the \"Edit\" screen. New tiles are now visible, and the instructional text changed from \"Hold and drag to rearrange tiles\" to \"Hold and drag to add tiles\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more content on the customization screen. However, the brightness slider is still not visible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500, 750] to [500, 250] (right to left) was intended to navigate to the next page of the quick settings panel. However, the action failed to change the page. The device remains on the second of three pages, as indicated by the highlighted dot at the bottom of the screen. The brightness slider is still not visible. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[500,800],\"end_point\":[500,200],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [500, 800] to [500, 200] to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500, 800] to [500, 200] (right to left) failed to change the page of the quick settings panel. The device remains on the second of three pages, and the brightness slider is still not visible. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[400,800],\"end_point\":[400,200],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [400, 800] to [400, 200] to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [400, 800] to [400, 200] (right to left) was intended to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. However, the action failed. The screen content remained unchanged, and the device is still on the second of three pages. The brightness slider is not visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal. Since multiple swipe attempts to change the page have failed, the next step should be to try an alternative method, such as tapping the edit button in the quick settings panel.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[624,898],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the edit button (pencil icon) located at approximately [624, 898] to customize the quick settings panel. This action is expected to open a screen where the brightness slider can be added or made visible. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the edit button (pencil icon) successfully navigated the agent to the \"Edit\" screen for quick settings tiles. The screen now displays \"Edit\" at the top and \"Hold and drag to rearrange tiles\". Various quick setting tiles are shown, and it\\'s possible to scroll to see more. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the customization options for the quick settings panel. The brightness slider is not yet visible, so further exploration of this screen is needed.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of quick settings tiles on the \"Edit\" screen. This action is expected to reveal more tiles, potentially including the brightness slider or an option to add it. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [200, 500] successfully scrolled the content on the \"Edit\" screen. New tiles are now visible, and the instructional text changed from \"Hold and drag to rearrange tiles\" to \"Hold and drag to add tiles\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more content on the customization screen. However, the brightness slider is still not visible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of quick settings tiles on the \"Edit\" screen. This action is expected to reveal more tiles, potentially including the brightness slider or an option to add it.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500, 800] to [500, 200] (right to left) failed to change the page of the quick settings panel. The device remains on the second of three pages, and the brightness slider is still not visible. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[400,800],\"end_point\":[400,200],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [400, 800] to [400, 200] to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [400, 800] to [400, 200] (right to left) was intended to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. However, the action failed. The screen content remained unchanged, and the device is still on the second of three pages. The brightness slider is not visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal. Since multiple swipe attempts to change the page have failed, the next step should be to try an alternative method, such as tapping the edit button in the quick settings panel.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[624,898],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the edit button (pencil icon) located at approximately [624, 898] to customize the quick settings panel. This action is expected to open a screen where the brightness slider can be added or made visible. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the edit button (pencil icon) successfully navigated the agent to the \"Edit\" screen for quick settings tiles. The screen now displays \"Edit\" at the top and \"Hold and drag to rearrange tiles\". Various quick setting tiles are shown, and it\\'s possible to scroll to see more. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the customization options for the quick settings panel. The brightness slider is not yet visible, so further exploration of this screen is needed.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of quick settings tiles on the \"Edit\" screen. This action is expected to reveal more tiles, potentially including the brightness slider or an option to add it. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [200, 500] successfully scrolled the content on the \"Edit\" screen. New tiles are now visible, and the instructional text changed from \"Hold and drag to rearrange tiles\" to \"Hold and drag to add tiles\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more content on the customization screen. However, the brightness slider is still not visible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of quick settings tiles on the \"Edit\" screen. This action is expected to reveal more tiles, potentially including the brightness slider or an option to add it. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [200, 500] successfully scrolled the content on the \"Edit\" screen. New tiles are now visible at the bottom of the list. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more content on the customization screen. However, the brightness slider is still not visible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'La ] 4Aoio [Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 679], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: -1.440\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 193, 96, 285], \\'text\\': \\'Edit\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [76, 855, 92, 963], \\'text\\': \\'RESET\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [187, 145, 209, 271], \\'text\\': \\'Overlay\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [282, 297, 303, 705], \\'text\\': \\'Hold and drag to add tiles\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [368, 148, 385, 289], \\'text\\': \\'Location\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [368, 616, 388, 751], \\'text\\': \\'Hotspot\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [465, 146, 482, 387], \\'text\\': \\'Color inversion\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [465, 618, 482, 793], \\'text\\': \\'Data Saver\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [562, 148, 578, 334], \\'text\\': \\'Dark theme\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [561, 616, 578, 874], \\'text\\': \\'Color correction\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [659, 148, 675, 356], \\'text\\': \\'Screen saver\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [780, 75, 820, 417], \\'text\\': \\'Focus mode (0) Digital Wellbeing\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [779, 617, 821, 887], \\'text\\': \\'Bedtime mode Digital Wellbeing\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [877, 150, 892, 300], \\'text\\': \\'New task\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [898, 146, 914, 247], \\'text\\': \\'Tasks\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [333, 35, 421, 493]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [430, 507, 518, 966]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [527, 34, 615, 494]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [527, 504, 615, 966]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [624, 34, 712, 494]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [852, 32, 940, 493]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [255, 25, 334, 983]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [154, 34, 242, 493]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [430, 33, 518, 494]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [755, 32, 843, 495]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [756, 503, 843, 967]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [637, 505, 756, 967]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 47, 108, 131]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [500, 800] to [500, 200] (right to left) failed to change the page of the quick settings panel. The device remains on the second of three pages, and the brightness slider is still not visible. The action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[400,800],\"end_point\":[400,200],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe left from [400, 800] to [400, 200] to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [400, 800] to [400, 200] (right to left) was intended to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. However, the action failed. The screen content remained unchanged, and the device is still on the second of three pages. The brightness slider is not visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal. Since multiple swipe attempts to change the page have failed, the next step should be to try an alternative method, such as tapping the edit button in the quick settings panel.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[624,898],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the edit button (pencil icon) located at approximately [624, 898] to customize the quick settings panel. This action is expected to open a screen where the brightness slider can be added or made visible. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the edit button (pencil icon) successfully navigated the agent to the \"Edit\" screen for quick settings tiles. The screen now displays \"Edit\" at the top and \"Hold and drag to rearrange tiles\". Various quick setting tiles are shown, and it\\'s possible to scroll to see more. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the customization options for the quick settings panel. The brightness slider is not yet visible, so further exploration of this screen is needed.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of quick settings tiles on the \"Edit\" screen. This action is expected to reveal more tiles, potentially including the brightness slider or an option to add it. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [200, 500] successfully scrolled the content on the \"Edit\" screen. New tiles are now visible, and the instructional text changed from \"Hold and drag to rearrange tiles\" to \"Hold and drag to add tiles\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more content on the customization screen. However, the brightness slider is still not visible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of quick settings tiles on the \"Edit\" screen. This action is expected to reveal more tiles, potentially including the brightness slider or an option to add it. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [200, 500] successfully scrolled the content on the \"Edit\" screen. New tiles are now visible at the bottom of the list. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more content on the customization screen. However, the brightness slider is still not visible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of quick settings tiles on the \"Edit\" screen.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[624,898],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the edit button (pencil icon) located at approximately [624, 898] to customize the quick settings panel. This action is expected to open a screen where the brightness slider can be added or made visible. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the edit button (pencil icon) successfully navigated the agent to the \"Edit\" screen for quick settings tiles. The screen now displays \"Edit\" at the top and \"Hold and drag to rearrange tiles\". Various quick setting tiles are shown, and it\\'s possible to scroll to see more. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the customization options for the quick settings panel. The brightness slider is not yet visible, so further exploration of this screen is needed.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of quick settings tiles on the \"Edit\" screen. This action is expected to reveal more tiles, potentially including the brightness slider or an option to add it. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [200, 500] successfully scrolled the content on the \"Edit\" screen. New tiles are now visible, and the instructional text changed from \"Hold and drag to rearrange tiles\" to \"Hold and drag to add tiles\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more content on the customization screen. However, the brightness slider is still not visible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of quick settings tiles on the \"Edit\" screen. This action is expected to reveal more tiles, potentially including the brightness slider or an option to add it. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [200, 500] successfully scrolled the content on the \"Edit\" screen. New tiles are now visible at the bottom of the list. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more content on the customization screen. However, the brightness slider is still not visible.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of quick settings tiles on the \"Edit\" screen. This action is expected to reveal more tiles, potentially including the brightness slider or an option to add it. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [200, 500] on the \\'Edit\\' screen did not change the screen content. This suggests that the bottom of the scrollable list of tiles has been reached. The brightness slider is still not visible. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. We need to go back to the quick settings panel to check for the brightness slider.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [400, 800] to [400, 200] (right to left) was intended to navigate to the third page of the quick settings panel. However, the action failed. The screen content remained unchanged, and the device is still on the second of three pages. The brightness slider is not visible. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the subgoal. Since multiple swipe attempts to change the page have failed, the next step should be to try an alternative method, such as tapping the edit button in the quick settings panel.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[624,898],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the edit button (pencil icon) located at approximately [624, 898] to customize the quick settings panel. This action is expected to open a screen where the brightness slider can be added or made visible. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the edit button (pencil icon) successfully navigated the agent to the \"Edit\" screen for quick settings tiles. The screen now displays \"Edit\" at the top and \"Hold and drag to rearrange tiles\". Various quick setting tiles are shown, and it\\'s possible to scroll to see more. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the customization options for the quick settings panel. The brightness slider is not yet visible, so further exploration of this screen is needed.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of quick settings tiles on the \"Edit\" screen. This action is expected to reveal more tiles, potentially including the brightness slider or an option to add it. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [200, 500] successfully scrolled the content on the \"Edit\" screen. New tiles are now visible, and the instructional text changed from \"Hold and drag to rearrange tiles\" to \"Hold and drag to add tiles\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more content on the customization screen. However, the brightness slider is still not visible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of quick settings tiles on the \"Edit\" screen. This action is expected to reveal more tiles, potentially including the brightness slider or an option to add it. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [200, 500] successfully scrolled the content on the \"Edit\" screen. New tiles are now visible at the bottom of the list. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more content on the customization screen. However, the brightness slider is still not visible.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of quick settings tiles on the \"Edit\" screen. This action is expected to reveal more tiles, potentially including the brightness slider or an option to add it. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [200, 500] on the \\'Edit\\' screen did not change the screen content. This suggests that the bottom of the scrollable list of tiles has been reached. The brightness slider is still not visible. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. We need to go back to the quick settings panel to check for the brightness slider.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,88],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located at approximately [87, 88], to exit the \"Edit\" screen and return to the quick settings panel. This action is expected to navigate back to the quick settings panel, where the brightness slider might be visible. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Quick Settings Panel\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The quick settings panel is open and the brightness slider is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Swiped down twice from the top of the screen.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 98, 362], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / JdX: 0.0 IdY: 0.0 15.44\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Jxv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 815, 87, 956], \\'text\\': \\'T-Mobile\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [111, 35, 128, 219], \\'text\\': \\'Sun, Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [111, 874, 127, 965], \\'text\\': \\'100%\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [245, 148, 281, 333], \\'text\\': \\'Internet AndroidWifi\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [244, 618, 261, 775], \\'text\\': \\'Bluetooth\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [267, 620, 282, 667], \\'text\\': \\'On\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [340, 147, 378, 376], \\'text\\': \\'Flashlight Camera in use\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [340, 618, 377, 852], \\'text\\': \\'Do Not Disturb Off\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [438, 151, 452, 247], \\'text\\': \\'Alarm\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [436, 617, 474, 853], \\'text\\': \\'Airplane mode Off\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [458, 150, 475, 357], \\'text\\': \\'No alarm set\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [534, 148, 571, 389], \\'text\\': \\'ntrols Devi Unavailable\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [534, 622, 549, 800], \\'text\\': \\'Auto-rotate\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [555, 620, 570, 667], \\'text\\': \\'On\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [220, 505, 307, 962]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [413, 35, 501, 494]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [316, 506, 404, 963]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [317, 34, 404, 492]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 503, 596, 972]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 31, 597, 493]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [921, 861, 966, 966]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [921, 742, 966, 848]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [159, 867, 196, 938]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [245, 397, 282, 475]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [531, 393, 573, 476]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [106, 753, 131, 835]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to open a screen where the brightness slider can be added or made visible. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the edit button (pencil icon) successfully navigated the agent to the \"Edit\" screen for quick settings tiles. The screen now displays \"Edit\" at the top and \"Hold and drag to rearrange tiles\". Various quick setting tiles are shown, and it\\'s possible to scroll to see more. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the customization options for the quick settings panel.

This action is expected to reveal more tiles, potentially including the brightness slider or an option to add it. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [200, 500] successfully scrolled the content on the \"Edit\" screen. New tiles are now visible, and the instructional text changed from \"Hold and drag to rearrange tiles\" to \"Hold and drag to add tiles\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more content on the customization screen. However, the brightness slider is still not visible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of quick settings tiles on the \"Edit\" screen. This action is expected to reveal more tiles, potentially including the brightness slider or an option to add it. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [200, 500] successfully scrolled the content on the \"Edit\" screen. New tiles are now visible at the bottom of the list. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more content on the customization screen. However, the brightness slider is still not visible.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of quick settings tiles on the \"Edit\" screen. This action is expected to reveal more tiles, potentially including the brightness slider or an option to add it. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [200, 500] on the \\'Edit\\' screen did not change the screen content. This suggests that the bottom of the scrollable list of tiles has been reached. The brightness slider is still not visible. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. We need to go back to the quick settings panel to check for the brightness slider.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,88],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located at approximately [87, 88], to exit the \"Edit\" screen and return to the quick settings panel. This action is expected to navigate back to the quick settings panel, where the brightness slider might be visible. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the back arrow icon successfully navigated the agent from the \"Edit\" screen back to the quick settings panel. The screen changed from the tile editing interface to the standard quick settings view. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by allowing a re-evaluation of the quick settings panel, but the brightness slider is still not visible. Therefore, an alternative approach is needed.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal more tiles, potentially including the brightness slider or an option to add it. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [200, 500] successfully scrolled the content on the \"Edit\" screen. New tiles are now visible, and the instructional text changed from \"Hold and drag to rearrange tiles\" to \"Hold and drag to add tiles\". This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more content on the customization screen. However, the brightness slider is still not visible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of quick settings tiles on the \"Edit\" screen. This action is expected to reveal more tiles, potentially including the brightness slider or an option to add it. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [200, 500] successfully scrolled the content on the \"Edit\" screen. New tiles are now visible at the bottom of the list. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more content on the customization screen. However, the brightness slider is still not visible.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of quick settings tiles on the \"Edit\" screen. This action is expected to reveal more tiles, potentially including the brightness slider or an option to add it. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [200, 500] on the \\'Edit\\' screen did not change the screen content. This suggests that the bottom of the scrollable list of tiles has been reached. The brightness slider is still not visible. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. We need to go back to the quick settings panel to check for the brightness slider.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,88],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located at approximately [87, 88], to exit the \"Edit\" screen and return to the quick settings panel. This action is expected to navigate back to the quick settings panel, where the brightness slider might be visible. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the back arrow icon successfully navigated the agent from the \"Edit\" screen back to the quick settings panel. The screen changed from the tile editing interface to the standard quick settings view. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by allowing a re-evaluation of the quick settings panel, but the brightness slider is still not visible. Therefore, an alternative approach is needed.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[943,795],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the settings icon (gear icon) located at approximately [943, 795] to open the main Settings app. This action is expected to navigate to the Settings app, where the brightness settings can be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the settings icon successfully opened the main Settings app. The screen changed from the quick settings panel to the Settings menu. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the main settings, where display settings and the brightness slider are typically located.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the Settings menu. This action is expected to reveal more settings options, including \\'Display\\', which is needed to adjust the screen brightness. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Quick Settings Panel\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The quick settings panel is open and the brightness slider is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Swiped down twice from the top of the screen.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.

This action is expected to reveal more tiles, potentially including the brightness slider or an option to add it. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [200, 500] successfully scrolled the content on the \"Edit\" screen. New tiles are now visible at the bottom of the list. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more content on the customization screen. However, the brightness slider is still not visible.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of quick settings tiles on the \"Edit\" screen. This action is expected to reveal more tiles, potentially including the brightness slider or an option to add it. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [200, 500] on the \\'Edit\\' screen did not change the screen content. This suggests that the bottom of the scrollable list of tiles has been reached. The brightness slider is still not visible. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. We need to go back to the quick settings panel to check for the brightness slider.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,88],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located at approximately [87, 88], to exit the \"Edit\" screen and return to the quick settings panel. This action is expected to navigate back to the quick settings panel, where the brightness slider might be visible. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the back arrow icon successfully navigated the agent from the \"Edit\" screen back to the quick settings panel. The screen changed from the tile editing interface to the standard quick settings view. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by allowing a re-evaluation of the quick settings panel, but the brightness slider is still not visible. Therefore, an alternative approach is needed.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[943,795],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the settings icon (gear icon) located at approximately [943, 795] to open the main Settings app. This action is expected to navigate to the Settings app, where the brightness settings can be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the settings icon successfully opened the main Settings app. The screen changed from the quick settings panel to the Settings menu. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the main settings, where display settings and the brightness slider are typically located.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the Settings menu. This action is expected to reveal more settings options, including \\'Display\\', which is needed to adjust the screen brightness. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the Settings menu, revealing more options. The \\'Display\\' option is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the \\'Display\\' settings accessible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.45\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'IdY:-1440.0 Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 679], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: -1.440\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [89, 170, 116, 519], \\'text\\': \\'Search settings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [183, 168, 227, 541], \\'text\\': \\'Storage 48% used 4.19 GB free\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [278, 170, 328, 659], \\'text\\': \\'Sound & vibration Volume; haptics; Do Not Disturb\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [373, 167, 423, 675], \\'text\\': \\'Display Dark theme; font size) brightness\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [470, 170, 520, 639], \\'text\\': \\'Wallpaper & style Colors; themed icons app grid\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [564, 171, 615, 564], \\'text\\': \\'Accessibility Display; interaction; audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [664, 168, 712, 801], \\'text\\': \\'Security Screen lock; Find My Device; app security\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [758, 170, 808, 842], \\'text\\': \\'Privacy Permissions; account activity; personal data\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [858, 172, 905, 713], \\'text\\': \\'Location On - 7 apps have access to location\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 167, 1000, 727], \\'text\\': \\'Safety & emergency Emergency SOS; medical info;alerts\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [835, 62, 932, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 248, 38, 295]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [738, 61, 835, 931]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [81, 73, 124, 159]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [644, 58, 739, 912]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [548, 58, 643, 942]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 56, 38, 186]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [932, 58, 1000, 1000]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

This action is expected to reveal more tiles, potentially including the brightness slider or an option to add it. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [200, 500] successfully scrolled the content on the \"Edit\" screen. New tiles are now visible at the bottom of the list. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing more content on the customization screen. However, the brightness slider is still not visible.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of quick settings tiles on the \"Edit\" screen. This action is expected to reveal more tiles, potentially including the brightness slider or an option to add it. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [200, 500] on the \\'Edit\\' screen did not change the screen content. This suggests that the bottom of the scrollable list of tiles has been reached. The brightness slider is still not visible. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. We need to go back to the quick settings panel to check for the brightness slider.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,88],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located at approximately [87, 88], to exit the \"Edit\" screen and return to the quick settings panel. This action is expected to navigate back to the quick settings panel, where the brightness slider might be visible. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the back arrow icon successfully navigated the agent from the \"Edit\" screen back to the quick settings panel. The screen changed from the tile editing interface to the standard quick settings view. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by allowing a re-evaluation of the quick settings panel, but the brightness slider is still not visible. Therefore, an alternative approach is needed.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[943,795],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the settings icon (gear icon) located at approximately [943, 795] to open the main Settings app. This action is expected to navigate to the Settings app, where the brightness settings can be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the settings icon successfully opened the main Settings app. The screen changed from the quick settings panel to the Settings menu. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the main settings, where display settings and the brightness slider are typically located.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the Settings menu. This action is expected to reveal more settings options, including \\'Display\\', which is needed to adjust the screen brightness. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the Settings menu, revealing more options. The \\'Display\\' option is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the \\'Display\\' settings accessible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 13: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,421],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Display\\' option, located at approximately [398, 421]. This action is expected to open the display settings screen, where the brightness slider should be located.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[943,795],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the settings icon (gear icon) located at approximately [943, 795] to open the main Settings app. This action is expected to navigate to the Settings app, where the brightness settings can be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the settings icon successfully opened the main Settings app. The screen changed from the quick settings panel to the Settings menu. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the main settings, where display settings and the brightness slider are typically located.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the Settings menu. This action is expected to reveal more settings options, including \\'Display\\', which is needed to adjust the screen brightness. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the Settings menu, revealing more options. The \\'Display\\' option is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the \\'Display\\' settings accessible.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,421],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Display\\' option, located at approximately [398, 421]. This action is expected to open the display settings screen, where the brightness slider should be located. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Display\\' option at [398, 421] did not lead to the Display settings screen as expected. Instead, it triggered an error pop-up titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\". This pop-up blocks interaction with the underlying Settings menu. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to finding the brightness slider and completing the active subgoal. The immediate next step is to close this error pop-up.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 42, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.45\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'[Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [89, 172, 116, 519], \\'text\\': \\'Search settings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [182, 167, 227, 541], \\'text\\': \\'Storage 48% used 4.19 GB free\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [278, 169, 328, 659], \\'text\\': \\'Sound & vibration Volume; haptics; Do Not Disturb\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [374, 171, 416, 638], \\'text\\': \\'Display Dark thome font cize hriahtne\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [433, 116, 487, 813], \\'text\\': \\'com.google.androidenvac cessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [516, 254, 540, 410], \\'text\\': \\'App info\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [570, 256, 591, 435], \\'text\\': \\'Close app\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [664, 170, 712, 801], \\'text\\': \\'Security Screen lock; Find My Device; app security\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [758, 169, 808, 842], \\'text\\': \\'Privacy Permissions; account activity; personal data\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [857, 172, 905, 713], \\'text\\': \\'Location On - 7 apps have access to location\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 167, 1000, 725], \\'text\\': \\'Safety & emergency Emergency $03,mcuicar nnur alerts\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 248, 37, 295]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [800, 500] to [200, 500] on the \\'Edit\\' screen did not change the screen content. This suggests that the bottom of the scrollable list of tiles has been reached. The brightness slider is still not visible. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. We need to go back to the quick settings panel to check for the brightness slider.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,88],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located at approximately [87, 88], to exit the \"Edit\" screen and return to the quick settings panel. This action is expected to navigate back to the quick settings panel, where the brightness slider might be visible. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the back arrow icon successfully navigated the agent from the \"Edit\" screen back to the quick settings panel. The screen changed from the tile editing interface to the standard quick settings view. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by allowing a re-evaluation of the quick settings panel, but the brightness slider is still not visible. Therefore, an alternative approach is needed.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[943,795],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the settings icon (gear icon) located at approximately [943, 795] to open the main Settings app. This action is expected to navigate to the Settings app, where the brightness settings can be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the settings icon successfully opened the main Settings app. The screen changed from the quick settings panel to the Settings menu. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the main settings, where display settings and the brightness slider are typically located.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the Settings menu. This action is expected to reveal more settings options, including \\'Display\\', which is needed to adjust the screen brightness. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the Settings menu, revealing more options. The \\'Display\\' option is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the \\'Display\\' settings accessible.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,421],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Display\\' option, located at approximately [398, 421]. This action is expected to open the display settings screen, where the brightness slider should be located. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Display\\' option at [398, 421] did not lead to the Display settings screen as expected. Instead, it triggered an error pop-up titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\". This pop-up blocks interaction with the underlying Settings menu. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to finding the brightness slider and completing the active subgoal. The immediate next step is to close this error pop-up.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 14: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Close app\\' at approximately [580, 345] to dismiss the error pop-up. This action is expected to close the pop-up and allow interaction with the underlying Settings menu. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Quick Settings Panel\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The quick settings panel is open and the brightness slider is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Swiped down twice from the top of the screen.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[87,88],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon, located at approximately [87, 88], to exit the \"Edit\" screen and return to the quick settings panel. This action is expected to navigate back to the quick settings panel, where the brightness slider might be visible. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the back arrow icon successfully navigated the agent from the \"Edit\" screen back to the quick settings panel. The screen changed from the tile editing interface to the standard quick settings view. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by allowing a re-evaluation of the quick settings panel, but the brightness slider is still not visible. Therefore, an alternative approach is needed.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[943,795],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the settings icon (gear icon) located at approximately [943, 795] to open the main Settings app. This action is expected to navigate to the Settings app, where the brightness settings can be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the settings icon successfully opened the main Settings app. The screen changed from the quick settings panel to the Settings menu. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the main settings, where display settings and the brightness slider are typically located.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the Settings menu. This action is expected to reveal more settings options, including \\'Display\\', which is needed to adjust the screen brightness. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the Settings menu, revealing more options. The \\'Display\\' option is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the \\'Display\\' settings accessible.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,421],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Display\\' option, located at approximately [398, 421]. This action is expected to open the display settings screen, where the brightness slider should be located. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Display\\' option at [398, 421] did not lead to the Display settings screen as expected. Instead, it triggered an error pop-up titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\". This pop-up blocks interaction with the underlying Settings menu. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to finding the brightness slider and completing the active subgoal. The immediate next step is to close this error pop-up.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Close app\\' at approximately [580, 345] to dismiss the error pop-up. This action is expected to close the pop-up and allow interaction with the underlying Settings menu. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Close app\\' at approximately [580, 345] successfully dismissed the error pop-up. The screen changed from showing the error pop-up overlaying the Settings menu to showing only the Settings menu. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing interaction with the underlying Settings menu again.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 15: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[943,795],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the settings icon (gear icon) located at approximately [943, 795] to open the main Settings app. This action is expected to navigate to the Settings app, where the brightness settings can be found. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the settings icon successfully opened the main Settings app. The screen changed from the quick settings panel to the Settings menu. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing access to the main settings, where display settings and the brightness slider are typically located.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the Settings menu. This action is expected to reveal more settings options, including \\'Display\\', which is needed to adjust the screen brightness. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the Settings menu, revealing more options. The \\'Display\\' option is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the \\'Display\\' settings accessible.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,421],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Display\\' option, located at approximately [398, 421]. This action is expected to open the display settings screen, where the brightness slider should be located. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Display\\' option at [398, 421] did not lead to the Display settings screen as expected. Instead, it triggered an error pop-up titled \"com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\". This pop-up blocks interaction with the underlying Settings menu. Therefore, the action failed to bring the agent closer to finding the brightness slider and completing the active subgoal. The immediate next step is to close this error pop-up.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Close app\\' at approximately [580, 345] to dismiss the error pop-up. This action is expected to close the pop-up and allow interaction with the underlying Settings menu. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'Close app\\' at approximately [580, 345] successfully dismissed the error pop-up. The screen changed from showing the error pop-up overlaying the Settings menu to showing only the Settings menu. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing interaction with the underlying Settings menu again.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,421],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Display\\' option, located at approximately [398, 421]. This action is expected to open the display settings screen, where the brightness slider should be located. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Display\\' option successfully opened the \\'Display\\' settings screen. The screen changed from the main Settings menu to the \\'Display\\' settings menu. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by revealing the brightness settings. The \\'Display\\' settings screen shows \\'Brightness level 100%\\', indicating that the brightness is already at its maximum value. Therefore, the user\\'s instruction is fulfilled.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.46\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [181, 55, 227, 349], \\'text\\': \\'Display\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [278, 54, 298, 225], \\'text\\': \\'Brightness\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 55, 372, 408], \\'text\\': \\'Brightness level 100%\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [420, 56, 440, 253], \\'text\\': \\'Lock display\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [470, 53, 515, 493], \\'text\\': \\'Lock screen Show all notification content\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [556, 56, 603, 394], \\'text\\': \\'Screen timeout After null of inactivity\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [648, 55, 669, 246], \\'text\\': \\'Appearance\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [698, 57, 720, 314], \\'text\\': \\'Dark theme\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [725, 56, 745, 538], \\'text\\': \\'Will never turn on automatically\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [784, 56, 827, 342], \\'text\\': \\'Screen saver On Clock\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [868, 52, 897, 512], \\'text\\': \\'Display size and text\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [941, 55, 957, 145], \\'text\\': \\'Color\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [702, 822, 736, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 250, 38, 294]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [312, 43, 401, 437]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 38, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 144, 38, 187]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14.

If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.
