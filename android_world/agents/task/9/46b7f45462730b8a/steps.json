Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [171, 47, 225, 391], \\'text\\': \\'Settings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [264, 170, 292, 519], \\'text\\': \\'Search settings\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [347, 173, 396, 587], \\'text\\': \\'Network & internet Mobile, Wi-Fi, hotspot\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [443, 171, 492, 595], \\'text\\': \\'Connected devices Bluetooth; pairing\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [541, 172, 589, 722], \\'text\\': \\'Apps Assistant; recent apps, default apps\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [637, 172, 684, 694], \\'text\\': \\'Notifications Notification history; conversations\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [731, 171, 777, 337], \\'text\\': \\'Battery 100%\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [830, 168, 873, 541], \\'text\\': \\'Storage 48% used 4.19 GB free\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [925, 171, 973, 658], \\'text\\': \\'Sound & vibration Volume; haptics, Do Not Disturb\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [326, 48, 423, 974]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [519, 55, 616, 995]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [423, 55, 522, 987]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [616, 58, 710, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 250, 38, 294]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [808, 60, 904, 904]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 40, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [712, 60, 807, 872]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [904, 64, 998, 1000]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

This action is expected to open the Settings app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Settings app icon successfully opened the Settings app. The main menu of the Settings app is now visible. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the settings menu. This is done to find the \\'Display\\' settings option, which is not currently visible. The predicted outcome is that the screen will scroll, revealing more settings options, hopefully including \\'Display\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the Settings menu, revealing the \\'Display\\' option. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the Display Settings. The next step is to tap on the \\'Display\\' option.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 2: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the Display Settings. The next step is to tap on the \\'Display\\' option.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[394,423],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Display\\' settings option, which is labeled \\'Display Dark theme; font size) brightness\\' and located at approximately [394, 423]. This action is expected to open the Display settings screen, allowing the agent to proceed with adjusting the brightness. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Display\\' option was successful. The \\'Display\\' settings screen is now open, showing options like \\'Brightness level\\', \\'Lock screen\\', \\'Dark theme\\', etc. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction by allowing access to brightness controls. The active subgoal \"Navigate to Display Settings\" is now complete.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[822,847],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Settings app icon (gear icon) located at coordinates [822, 847]. This action is expected to open the Settings app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Settings app icon successfully opened the Settings app. The main menu of the Settings app is now visible. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the settings menu. This is done to find the \\'Display\\' settings option, which is not currently visible. The predicted outcome is that the screen will scroll, revealing more settings options, hopefully including \\'Display\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the Settings menu, revealing the \\'Display\\' option. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the Display Settings. The next step is to tap on the \\'Display\\' option.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[394,423],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Display\\' settings option, which is labeled \\'Display Dark theme; font size) brightness\\' and located at approximately [394, 423]. This action is expected to open the Display settings screen, allowing the agent to proceed with adjusting the brightness. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Display\\' option was successful. The \\'Display\\' settings screen is now open, showing options like \\'Brightness level\\', \\'Lock screen\\', \\'Dark theme\\', etc. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction by allowing access to brightness controls. The active subgoal \"Navigate to Display Settings\" is now complete.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,231],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Brightness level 0%\\' located at approximately [350, 231]. This action is expected to open the brightness adjustment control or directly allow adjusting the brightness. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Brightness level 0%\\' at [350, 231] did not produce any visible change on the screen. No brightness control, slider, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. A different interaction is needed to find and manipulate the brightness setting.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 710, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [181, 55, 227, 349], \\'text\\': \\'Display\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [278, 54, 298, 225], \\'text\\': \\'Brightness\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 55, 372, 408], \\'text\\': \\'Brightness level 0%\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [420, 56, 440, 253], \\'text\\': \\'Lock display\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [470, 53, 515, 493], \\'text\\': \\'Lock screen Show all notification content\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [556, 56, 603, 394], \\'text\\': \\'Screen timeout After null of inactivity\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [648, 55, 669, 246], \\'text\\': \\'Appearance\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [698, 57, 720, 314], \\'text\\': \\'Dark theme\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [725, 56, 745, 538], \\'text\\': \\'Will never turn on automatically\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [784, 56, 827, 342], \\'text\\': \\'Screen saver On Clock\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [868, 52, 897, 512], \\'text\\': \\'Display size and text\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [941, 55, 957, 145], \\'text\\': \\'Color\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [702, 821, 736, 965]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 246, 38, 297]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 193, 37, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 141, 37, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [541, 12, 631, 977]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [680, 13, 768, 802]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 819, 42, 941]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11.

Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[822,847],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Settings app icon (gear icon) located at coordinates [822, 847]. This action is expected to open the Settings app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Settings app icon successfully opened the Settings app. The main menu of the Settings app is now visible. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the settings menu. This is done to find the \\'Display\\' settings option, which is not currently visible. The predicted outcome is that the screen will scroll, revealing more settings options, hopefully including \\'Display\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the Settings menu, revealing the \\'Display\\' option. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the Display Settings. The next step is to tap on the \\'Display\\' option.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[394,423],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Display\\' settings option, which is labeled \\'Display Dark theme; font size) brightness\\' and located at approximately [394, 423]. This action is expected to open the Display settings screen, allowing the agent to proceed with adjusting the brightness. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Display\\' option was successful. The \\'Display\\' settings screen is now open, showing options like \\'Brightness level\\', \\'Lock screen\\', \\'Dark theme\\', etc. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction by allowing access to brightness controls. The active subgoal \"Navigate to Display Settings\" is now complete.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,231],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Brightness level 0%\\' located at approximately [350, 231]. This action is expected to open the brightness adjustment control or directly allow adjusting the brightness. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Brightness level 0%\\' at [350, 231] did not produce any visible change on the screen. No brightness control, slider, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. A different interaction is needed to find and manipulate the brightness setting.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[288,139],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Brightness\\' category label, located at approximately [288, 139]. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider or controls, allowing the agent to adjust the brightness to the maximum value. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Settings App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Settings app is open and its main menu is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Tapped on the \\'Settings\\' app icon.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[822,847],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Settings app icon (gear icon) located at coordinates [822, 847]. This action is expected to open the Settings app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Settings app icon successfully opened the Settings app. The main menu of the Settings app is now visible. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the settings menu. This is done to find the \\'Display\\' settings option, which is not currently visible. The predicted outcome is that the screen will scroll, revealing more settings options, hopefully including \\'Display\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the Settings menu, revealing the \\'Display\\' option. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the Display Settings. The next step is to tap on the \\'Display\\' option.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[394,423],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Display\\' settings option, which is labeled \\'Display Dark theme; font size) brightness\\' and located at approximately [394, 423]. This action is expected to open the Display settings screen, allowing the agent to proceed with adjusting the brightness. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Display\\' option was successful. The \\'Display\\' settings screen is now open, showing options like \\'Brightness level\\', \\'Lock screen\\', \\'Dark theme\\', etc. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction by allowing access to brightness controls. The active subgoal \"Navigate to Display Settings\" is now complete.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,231],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Brightness level 0%\\' located at approximately [350, 231]. This action is expected to open the brightness adjustment control or directly allow adjusting the brightness. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Brightness level 0%\\' at [350, 231] did not produce any visible change on the screen. No brightness control, slider, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. A different interaction is needed to find and manipulate the brightness setting.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[288,139],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Brightness\\' category label, located at approximately [288, 139]. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider or controls, allowing the agent to adjust the brightness to the maximum value. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Brightness\\' category label at [288, 139] did not produce any visible change on the screen. No brightness control, slider, or pop-up appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. A different interaction is needed. The next step is to try swiping on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' text, as it might be a slider.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 45, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [181, 55, 227, 349], \\'text\\': \\'Display\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [278, 54, 298, 225], \\'text\\': \\'Brightness\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 55, 372, 408], \\'text\\': \\'Brightness level 0%\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [420, 56, 440, 253], \\'text\\': \\'Lock display\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [470, 53, 515, 493], \\'text\\': \\'Lock screen Show all notification content\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [556, 56, 603, 394], \\'text\\': \\'Screen timeout After null of inactivity\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [648, 55, 669, 246], \\'text\\': \\'Appearance\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [698, 57, 720, 314], \\'text\\': \\'Dark theme\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [725, 56, 745, 538], \\'text\\': \\'Will never turn on automatically\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [784, 56, 827, 342], \\'text\\': \\'Screen saver On Clock\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [868, 52, 897, 512], \\'text\\': \\'Display size and text\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [941, 55, 957, 145], \\'text\\': \\'Color\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [702, 822, 736, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 250, 37, 294]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 38, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 143, 37, 186]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[822,847],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the Settings app icon (gear icon) located at coordinates [822, 847]. This action is expected to open the Settings app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the Settings app icon successfully opened the Settings app. The main menu of the Settings app is now visible. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the settings menu. This is done to find the \\'Display\\' settings option, which is not currently visible. The predicted outcome is that the screen will scroll, revealing more settings options, hopefully including \\'Display\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the Settings menu, revealing the \\'Display\\' option. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the Display Settings. The next step is to tap on the \\'Display\\' option.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[394,423],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Display\\' settings option, which is labeled \\'Display Dark theme; font size) brightness\\' and located at approximately [394, 423]. This action is expected to open the Display settings screen, allowing the agent to proceed with adjusting the brightness. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Display\\' option was successful. The \\'Display\\' settings screen is now open, showing options like \\'Brightness level\\', \\'Lock screen\\', \\'Dark theme\\', etc. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction by allowing access to brightness controls. The active subgoal \"Navigate to Display Settings\" is now complete.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,231],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Brightness level 0%\\' located at approximately [350, 231]. This action is expected to open the brightness adjustment control or directly allow adjusting the brightness. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Brightness level 0%\\' at [350, 231] did not produce any visible change on the screen. No brightness control, slider, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. A different interaction is needed to find and manipulate the brightness setting.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[288,139],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Brightness\\' category label, located at approximately [288, 139]. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider or controls, allowing the agent to adjust the brightness to the maximum value. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Brightness\\' category label at [288, 139] did not produce any visible change on the screen. No brightness control, slider, or pop-up appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. A different interaction is needed. The next step is to try swiping on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' text, as it might be a slider.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[350,100],\"end_point\":[350,400],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe right on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' area, which is located approximately between [328, 55] and [372, 408]. The swipe will start at [350, 100] and end at [350, 400]. This action is an attempt to interact with a potential hidden slider to increase the brightness to its maximum value. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Settings App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Settings app is open and its main menu is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Tapped on the \\'Settings\\' app icon.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 67, 250], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 3240\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 531], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.324\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 710, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [181, 55, 227, 349], \\'text\\': \\'Display\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [278, 54, 298, 225], \\'text\\': \\'Brightness\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 57, 372, 408], \\'text\\': \\'Brightness_level 0%\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [420, 56, 440, 253], \\'text\\': \\'Lock display\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [470, 53, 515, 493], \\'text\\': \\'Lock screen Show all notification content\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [556, 56, 603, 394], \\'text\\': \\'Screen timeout After null of inactivity\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [648, 55, 669, 246], \\'text\\': \\'Appearance\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [698, 57, 720, 314], \\'text\\': \\'Dark theme\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [725, 56, 745, 538], \\'text\\': \\'Will never turn on automatically\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [784, 56, 827, 342], \\'text\\': \\'Screen saver On Clock\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [868, 52, 897, 512], \\'text\\': \\'Display size and text\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [941, 55, 957, 145], \\'text\\': \\'Color\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [702, 821, 736, 965]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 141, 37, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 193, 37, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 247, 38, 296]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [325, 60, 352, 408]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 820, 42, 945]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [766, 4, 850, 603]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [680, 17, 767, 789]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is done to find the \\'Display\\' settings option, which is not currently visible. The predicted outcome is that the screen will scroll, revealing more settings options, hopefully including \\'Display\\'. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the Settings menu, revealing the \\'Display\\' option. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the Display Settings. The next step is to tap on the \\'Display\\' option.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[394,423],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Display\\' settings option, which is labeled \\'Display Dark theme; font size) brightness\\' and located at approximately [394, 423]. This action is expected to open the Display settings screen, allowing the agent to proceed with adjusting the brightness. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Display\\' option was successful. The \\'Display\\' settings screen is now open, showing options like \\'Brightness level\\', \\'Lock screen\\', \\'Dark theme\\', etc. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction by allowing access to brightness controls. The active subgoal \"Navigate to Display Settings\" is now complete.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,231],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Brightness level 0%\\' located at approximately [350, 231]. This action is expected to open the brightness adjustment control or directly allow adjusting the brightness. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Brightness level 0%\\' at [350, 231] did not produce any visible change on the screen. No brightness control, slider, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. A different interaction is needed to find and manipulate the brightness setting.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to open the Display settings screen, allowing the agent to proceed with adjusting the brightness. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Display\\' option was successful. The \\'Display\\' settings screen is now open, showing options like \\'Brightness level\\', \\'Lock screen\\', \\'Dark theme\\', etc. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction by allowing access to brightness controls.

This action is expected to open the brightness adjustment control or directly allow adjusting the brightness. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Brightness level 0%\\' at [350, 231] did not produce any visible change on the screen. No brightness control, slider, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[394,423],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Display\\' settings option, which is labeled \\'Display Dark theme; font size) brightness\\' and located at approximately [394, 423]. This action is expected to open the Display settings screen, allowing the agent to proceed with adjusting the brightness. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Display\\' option was successful. The \\'Display\\' settings screen is now open, showing options like \\'Brightness level\\', \\'Lock screen\\', \\'Dark theme\\', etc. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction by allowing access to brightness controls. The active subgoal \"Navigate to Display Settings\" is now complete.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,231],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Brightness level 0%\\' located at approximately [350, 231]. This action is expected to open the brightness adjustment control or directly allow adjusting the brightness. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Brightness level 0%\\' at [350, 231] did not produce any visible change on the screen. No brightness control, slider, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. A different interaction is needed to find and manipulate the brightness setting.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[288,139],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Brightness\\' category label, located at approximately [288, 139]. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider or controls, allowing the agent to adjust the brightness to the maximum value. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Brightness\\' category label at [288, 139] did not produce any visible change on the screen. No brightness control, slider, or pop-up appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. A different interaction is needed. The next step is to try swiping on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' text, as it might be a slider.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[350,100],\"end_point\":[350,400],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe right on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' area, which is located approximately between [328, 55] and [372, 408]. The swipe will start at [350, 100] and end at [350, 400]. This action is an attempt to interact with a potential hidden slider to increase the brightness to its maximum value. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' area from [350, 100] to [350, 400] did not produce any visible change on the screen. The \\'Brightness level\\' remains at \\'0%\\', and no brightness slider or control appeared. This action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness. It suggests that the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element is not a slider that responds to this type of swipe, or the swipe was not registered as intended.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,232],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' text, located at approximately [350, 232] (center of bounding box [328, 57, 372, 408]). This action is expected to reveal a brightness slider or control, allowing the brightness to be adjusted. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' text at approximately [350, 232], did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Brightness level\\' remains at \\'0%\\', and no brightness slider, control, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to find and interact with the brightness control.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[339,232],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Brightness level\\' at approximately [339, 232]. This text is part of the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element. This action is expected to open a brightness slider or control, allowing the brightness to be adjusted. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Settings App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Settings app is open and its main menu is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Tapped on the \\'Settings\\' app icon.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.

This action is expected to open the brightness adjustment control or directly allow adjusting the brightness. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Brightness level 0%\\' at [350, 231] did not produce any visible change on the screen. No brightness control, slider, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. A different interaction is needed to find and manipulate the brightness setting.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[288,139],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Brightness\\' category label, located at approximately [288, 139]. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider or controls, allowing the agent to adjust the brightness to the maximum value. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Brightness\\' category label at [288, 139] did not produce any visible change on the screen. No brightness control, slider, or pop-up appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. A different interaction is needed. The next step is to try swiping on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' text, as it might be a slider.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[350,100],\"end_point\":[350,400],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe right on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' area, which is located approximately between [328, 55] and [372, 408]. The swipe will start at [350, 100] and end at [350, 400]. This action is an attempt to interact with a potential hidden slider to increase the brightness to its maximum value. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' area from [350, 100] to [350, 400] did not produce any visible change on the screen. The \\'Brightness level\\' remains at \\'0%\\', and no brightness slider or control appeared. This action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness. It suggests that the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element is not a slider that responds to this type of swipe, or the swipe was not registered as intended.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,232],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' text, located at approximately [350, 232] (center of bounding box [328, 57, 372, 408]). This action is expected to reveal a brightness slider or control, allowing the brightness to be adjusted. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' text at approximately [350, 232], did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Brightness level\\' remains at \\'0%\\', and no brightness slider, control, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to find and interact with the brightness control.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[339,232],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Brightness level\\' at approximately [339, 232]. This text is part of the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element. This action is expected to open a brightness slider or control, allowing the brightness to be adjusted. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the \\'Brightness level\\' text at approximately [339, 232], did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Display\\' settings screen remains the same, and the \\'Brightness level\\' still indicates \\'0%\\'. No brightness slider, control, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to find and interact with the brightness control.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.42\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 710, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [181, 55, 227, 349], \\'text\\': \\'Display\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [278, 54, 298, 225], \\'text\\': \\'Brightness\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 55, 372, 408], \\'text\\': \\'Brightness level 0%\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [420, 56, 440, 253], \\'text\\': \\'Lock display\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [470, 53, 515, 493], \\'text\\': \\'Lock screen Show all notification content\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [556, 56, 603, 394], \\'text\\': \\'Screen timeout After null of inactivity\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [648, 55, 669, 246], \\'text\\': \\'Appearance\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [698, 57, 720, 314], \\'text\\': \\'Dark theme\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [725, 56, 745, 538], \\'text\\': \\'Will never turn on automatically\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [784, 56, 827, 342], \\'text\\': \\'Screen saver On Clock\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [868, 52, 897, 512], \\'text\\': \\'Display size and text\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [941, 55, 957, 145], \\'text\\': \\'Color\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [702, 821, 736, 965]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 245, 38, 297]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 193, 37, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 141, 37, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [541, 12, 631, 976]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [680, 13, 768, 802]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 820, 42, 941]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,231],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Brightness level 0%\\' located at approximately [350, 231]. This action is expected to open the brightness adjustment control or directly allow adjusting the brightness. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Brightness level 0%\\' at [350, 231] did not produce any visible change on the screen. No brightness control, slider, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action did not bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. A different interaction is needed to find and manipulate the brightness setting.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[288,139],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Brightness\\' category label, located at approximately [288, 139]. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider or controls, allowing the agent to adjust the brightness to the maximum value. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Brightness\\' category label at [288, 139] did not produce any visible change on the screen. No brightness control, slider, or pop-up appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. A different interaction is needed. The next step is to try swiping on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' text, as it might be a slider.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[350,100],\"end_point\":[350,400],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe right on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' area, which is located approximately between [328, 55] and [372, 408]. The swipe will start at [350, 100] and end at [350, 400]. This action is an attempt to interact with a potential hidden slider to increase the brightness to its maximum value. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' area from [350, 100] to [350, 400] did not produce any visible change on the screen. The \\'Brightness level\\' remains at \\'0%\\', and no brightness slider or control appeared. This action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness. It suggests that the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element is not a slider that responds to this type of swipe, or the swipe was not registered as intended.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,232],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' text, located at approximately [350, 232] (center of bounding box [328, 57, 372, 408]). This action is expected to reveal a brightness slider or control, allowing the brightness to be adjusted. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' text at approximately [350, 232], did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Brightness level\\' remains at \\'0%\\', and no brightness slider, control, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to find and interact with the brightness control.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[339,232],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Brightness level\\' at approximately [339, 232]. This text is part of the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element. This action is expected to open a brightness slider or control, allowing the brightness to be adjusted. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the \\'Brightness level\\' text at approximately [339, 232], did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Display\\' settings screen remains the same, and the \\'Brightness level\\' still indicates \\'0%\\'. No brightness slider, control, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to find and interact with the brightness control.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[350,65],\"end_point\":[350,398],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from left to right across the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element. The element is located at bounding box [328, 55, 372, 408]. The swipe will start at [350, 65] and end at [350, 398]. This action attempts to interact with the element as if it were a slider to increase the screen brightness. Currently, the brightness level is displayed as \\'0%\\'. It is predicted that this swipe will increase the brightness, and the text \\'0%\\' will change to a higher value. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Settings App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Settings app is open and its main menu is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Tapped on the \\'Settings\\' app icon.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[288,139],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Brightness\\' category label, located at approximately [288, 139]. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider or controls, allowing the agent to adjust the brightness to the maximum value. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Brightness\\' category label at [288, 139] did not produce any visible change on the screen. No brightness control, slider, or pop-up appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. A different interaction is needed. The next step is to try swiping on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' text, as it might be a slider.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[350,100],\"end_point\":[350,400],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe right on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' area, which is located approximately between [328, 55] and [372, 408]. The swipe will start at [350, 100] and end at [350, 400]. This action is an attempt to interact with a potential hidden slider to increase the brightness to its maximum value. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' area from [350, 100] to [350, 400] did not produce any visible change on the screen. The \\'Brightness level\\' remains at \\'0%\\', and no brightness slider or control appeared. This action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness. It suggests that the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element is not a slider that responds to this type of swipe, or the swipe was not registered as intended.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,232],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' text, located at approximately [350, 232] (center of bounding box [328, 57, 372, 408]). This action is expected to reveal a brightness slider or control, allowing the brightness to be adjusted. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' text at approximately [350, 232], did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Brightness level\\' remains at \\'0%\\', and no brightness slider, control, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to find and interact with the brightness control.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[339,232],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Brightness level\\' at approximately [339, 232]. This text is part of the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element. This action is expected to open a brightness slider or control, allowing the brightness to be adjusted. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the \\'Brightness level\\' text at approximately [339, 232], did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Display\\' settings screen remains the same, and the \\'Brightness level\\' still indicates \\'0%\\'. No brightness slider, control, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to find and interact with the brightness control.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[350,65],\"end_point\":[350,398],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from left to right across the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element. The element is located at bounding box [328, 55, 372, 408]. The swipe will start at [350, 65] and end at [350, 398]. This action attempts to interact with the element as if it were a slider to increase the screen brightness. Currently, the brightness level is displayed as \\'0%\\'. It is predicted that this swipe will increase the brightness, and the text \\'0%\\' will change to a higher value. Actual Outcome: The last action, a horizontal swipe from [350, 65] to [350, 398] across the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element (bounding box [328, 55, 372, 408]), did not result in any change to the screen brightness or UI. The \\'Brightness level\\' still shows \\'0%\\'. This action failed to adjust the brightness and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.44\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 248], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 359.6\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 531], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.360\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [181, 55, 227, 349], \\'text\\': \\'Display\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [278, 54, 298, 225], \\'text\\': \\'Brightness\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 57, 372, 408], \\'text\\': \\'Brightness_level 0%\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [420, 56, 440, 253], \\'text\\': \\'Lock display\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [470, 53, 515, 493], \\'text\\': \\'Lock screen Show all notification content\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [556, 56, 603, 394], \\'text\\': \\'Screen timeout After null of inactivity\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [648, 55, 669, 246], \\'text\\': \\'Appearance\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [698, 57, 720, 314], \\'text\\': \\'Dark theme\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [725, 56, 745, 538], \\'text\\': \\'Will never turn on automatically\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [784, 56, 827, 342], \\'text\\': \\'Screen saver On Clock\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [868, 52, 897, 512], \\'text\\': \\'Display size and text\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [941, 55, 957, 145], \\'text\\': \\'Color\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [702, 822, 736, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [325, 60, 352, 407]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 249, 37, 294]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 38, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [767, 6, 851, 612]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[288,139],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Brightness\\' category label, located at approximately [288, 139]. This action is expected to reveal the brightness slider or controls, allowing the agent to adjust the brightness to the maximum value. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Brightness\\' category label at [288, 139] did not produce any visible change on the screen. No brightness control, slider, or pop-up appeared. This action did not bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. A different interaction is needed. The next step is to try swiping on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' text, as it might be a slider.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[350,100],\"end_point\":[350,400],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe right on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' area, which is located approximately between [328, 55] and [372, 408]. The swipe will start at [350, 100] and end at [350, 400]. This action is an attempt to interact with a potential hidden slider to increase the brightness to its maximum value. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' area from [350, 100] to [350, 400] did not produce any visible change on the screen. The \\'Brightness level\\' remains at \\'0%\\', and no brightness slider or control appeared. This action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness. It suggests that the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element is not a slider that responds to this type of swipe, or the swipe was not registered as intended.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,232],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' text, located at approximately [350, 232] (center of bounding box [328, 57, 372, 408]). This action is expected to reveal a brightness slider or control, allowing the brightness to be adjusted. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' text at approximately [350, 232], did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Brightness level\\' remains at \\'0%\\', and no brightness slider, control, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to find and interact with the brightness control.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[339,232],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Brightness level\\' at approximately [339, 232]. This text is part of the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element. This action is expected to open a brightness slider or control, allowing the brightness to be adjusted. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the \\'Brightness level\\' text at approximately [339, 232], did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Display\\' settings screen remains the same, and the \\'Brightness level\\' still indicates \\'0%\\'. No brightness slider, control, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to find and interact with the brightness control.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[350,65],\"end_point\":[350,398],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from left to right across the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element. The element is located at bounding box [328, 55, 372, 408]. The swipe will start at [350, 65] and end at [350, 398]. This action attempts to interact with the element as if it were a slider to increase the screen brightness. Currently, the brightness level is displayed as \\'0%\\'. It is predicted that this swipe will increase the brightness, and the text \\'0%\\' will change to a higher value. Actual Outcome: The last action, a horizontal swipe from [350, 65] to [350, 398] across the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element (bounding box [328, 55, 372, 408]), did not result in any change to the screen brightness or UI. The \\'Brightness level\\' still shows \\'0%\\'. This action failed to adjust the brightness and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[350,232],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the center of the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element, which is located at approximately [350, 232] (center of bounding box [328, 57, 372, 408]). This action is an attempt to reveal a brightness slider or other controls, as previous tap and swipe actions were unsuccessful. It is predicted that this long press might open a dialog, reveal a slider, or change the brightness value directly. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Settings App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Settings app is open and its main menu is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Tapped on the \\'Settings\\' app icon.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[350,100],\"end_point\":[350,400],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe right on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' area, which is located approximately between [328, 55] and [372, 408]. The swipe will start at [350, 100] and end at [350, 400]. This action is an attempt to interact with a potential hidden slider to increase the brightness to its maximum value. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' area from [350, 100] to [350, 400] did not produce any visible change on the screen. The \\'Brightness level\\' remains at \\'0%\\', and no brightness slider or control appeared. This action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness. It suggests that the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element is not a slider that responds to this type of swipe, or the swipe was not registered as intended.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,232],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' text, located at approximately [350, 232] (center of bounding box [328, 57, 372, 408]). This action is expected to reveal a brightness slider or control, allowing the brightness to be adjusted. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' text at approximately [350, 232], did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Brightness level\\' remains at \\'0%\\', and no brightness slider, control, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to find and interact with the brightness control.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[339,232],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Brightness level\\' at approximately [339, 232]. This text is part of the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element. This action is expected to open a brightness slider or control, allowing the brightness to be adjusted. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the \\'Brightness level\\' text at approximately [339, 232], did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Display\\' settings screen remains the same, and the \\'Brightness level\\' still indicates \\'0%\\'. No brightness slider, control, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to find and interact with the brightness control.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[350,65],\"end_point\":[350,398],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from left to right across the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element. The element is located at bounding box [328, 55, 372, 408]. The swipe will start at [350, 65] and end at [350, 398]. This action attempts to interact with the element as if it were a slider to increase the screen brightness. Currently, the brightness level is displayed as \\'0%\\'. It is predicted that this swipe will increase the brightness, and the text \\'0%\\' will change to a higher value. Actual Outcome: The last action, a horizontal swipe from [350, 65] to [350, 398] across the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element (bounding box [328, 55, 372, 408]), did not result in any change to the screen brightness or UI. The \\'Brightness level\\' still shows \\'0%\\'. This action failed to adjust the brightness and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[350,232],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the center of the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element, which is located at approximately [350, 232] (center of bounding box [328, 57, 372, 408]). This action is an attempt to reveal a brightness slider or other controls, as previous tap and swipe actions were unsuccessful. It is predicted that this long press might open a dialog, reveal a slider, or change the brightness value directly. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element at approximately [350, 232] (center of bounding box [328, 57, 372, 408]) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Display\\' settings screen remains the same, the \\'Brightness level\\' still indicates \\'0%\\', and no brightness slider, control, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to find and interact with the brightness control.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 35, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.45\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 710, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [181, 55, 227, 349], \\'text\\': \\'Display\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [278, 54, 298, 225], \\'text\\': \\'Brightness\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 55, 372, 408], \\'text\\': \\'Brightness level 0%\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [420, 56, 440, 253], \\'text\\': \\'Lock display\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [470, 53, 515, 493], \\'text\\': \\'Lock screen Show all notification content\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [556, 56, 603, 394], \\'text\\': \\'Screen timeout After null of inactivity\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [648, 55, 669, 246], \\'text\\': \\'Appearance\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [698, 57, 720, 314], \\'text\\': \\'Dark theme\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [725, 56, 745, 538], \\'text\\': \\'Will never turn on automatically\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [784, 56, 827, 342], \\'text\\': \\'Screen saver On Clock\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [868, 52, 897, 512], \\'text\\': \\'Display size and text\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [941, 55, 957, 145], \\'text\\': \\'Color\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [702, 821, 736, 965]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 193, 37, 241]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 246, 38, 297]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [541, 12, 631, 977]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 141, 37, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [680, 13, 768, 802]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 819, 42, 942]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The swipe will start at [350, 100] and end at [350, 400]. This action is an attempt to interact with a potential hidden slider to increase the brightness to its maximum value. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' area from [350, 100] to [350, 400] did not produce any visible change on the screen. The \\'Brightness level\\' remains at \\'0%\\', and no brightness slider or control appeared. This action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness. It suggests that the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element is not a slider that responds to this type of swipe, or the swipe was not registered as intended.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,232],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' text, located at approximately [350, 232] (center of bounding box [328, 57, 372, 408]). This action is expected to reveal a brightness slider or control, allowing the brightness to be adjusted. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' text at approximately [350, 232], did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Brightness level\\' remains at \\'0%\\', and no brightness slider, control, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to find and interact with the brightness control.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[339,232],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Brightness level\\' at approximately [339, 232]. This text is part of the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element. This action is expected to open a brightness slider or control, allowing the brightness to be adjusted. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the \\'Brightness level\\' text at approximately [339, 232], did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Display\\' settings screen remains the same, and the \\'Brightness level\\' still indicates \\'0%\\'. No brightness slider, control, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to find and interact with the brightness control.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[350,65],\"end_point\":[350,398],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from left to right across the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element. The element is located at bounding box [328, 55, 372, 408]. The swipe will start at [350, 65] and end at [350, 398]. This action attempts to interact with the element as if it were a slider to increase the screen brightness. Currently, the brightness level is displayed as \\'0%\\'. It is predicted that this swipe will increase the brightness, and the text \\'0%\\' will change to a higher value. Actual Outcome: The last action, a horizontal swipe from [350, 65] to [350, 398] across the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element (bounding box [328, 55, 372, 408]), did not result in any change to the screen brightness or UI. The \\'Brightness level\\' still shows \\'0%\\'. This action failed to adjust the brightness and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[350,232],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the center of the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element, which is located at approximately [350, 232] (center of bounding box [328, 57, 372, 408]). This action is an attempt to reveal a brightness slider or other controls, as previous tap and swipe actions were unsuccessful. It is predicted that this long press might open a dialog, reveal a slider, or change the brightness value directly. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element at approximately [350, 232] (center of bounding box [328, 57, 372, 408]) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Display\\' settings screen remains the same, the \\'Brightness level\\' still indicates \\'0%\\', and no brightness slider, control, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to find and interact with the brightness control.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,174],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Brightness level\\' text, which is part of the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element. The approximate coordinates for the tap are [350, 174], based on the bounding box [328, 55, 372, 408] for \\'Brightness level 0%\\'. This action is expected to open a brightness slider or a dialog allowing brightness adjustment. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Settings App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Settings app is open and its main menu is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Tapped on the \\'Settings\\' app icon.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action failed to adjust the brightness and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[350,232],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the center of the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element, which is located at approximately [350, 232] (center of bounding box [328, 57, 372, 408]). This action is an attempt to reveal a brightness slider or other controls, as previous tap and swipe actions were unsuccessful. It is predicted that this long press might open a dialog, reveal a slider, or change the brightness value directly. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element at approximately [350, 232] (center of bounding box [328, 57, 372, 408]) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Display\\' settings screen remains the same, the \\'Brightness level\\' still indicates \\'0%\\', and no brightness slider, control, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to find and interact with the brightness control.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,174],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Brightness level\\' text, which is part of the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element. The approximate coordinates for the tap are [350, 174], based on the bounding box [328, 55, 372, 408] for \\'Brightness level 0%\\'. This action is expected to open a brightness slider or a dialog allowing brightness adjustment. Actual Outcome: The last action was a tap on the settings icon in the top-left corner (coordinates of tap based on red ring). This caused the settings icon to change to a back arrow. However, the screen content (\"Display\" settings) did not change. No brightness slider, control, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.47\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [181, 55, 227, 349], \\'text\\': \\'Display\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [278, 54, 298, 225], \\'text\\': \\'Brightness\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [328, 55, 372, 408], \\'text\\': \\'Brightness level 0%\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [420, 56, 440, 253], \\'text\\': \\'Lock display\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [470, 53, 515, 493], \\'text\\': \\'Lock screen Show all notification content\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [556, 56, 603, 394], \\'text\\': \\'Screen timeout After null of inactivity\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [648, 55, 669, 246], \\'text\\': \\'Appearance\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [698, 57, 720, 314], \\'text\\': \\'Dark theme\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [725, 56, 745, 538], \\'text\\': \\'Will never turn on automatically\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [784, 56, 827, 342], \\'text\\': \\'Screen saver On Clock\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [868, 52, 897, 512], \\'text\\': \\'Display size and text\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [941, 55, 957, 145], \\'text\\': \\'Color\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [702, 822, 736, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 250, 38, 295]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 38, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 143, 38, 186]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[339,232],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the text \\'Brightness level\\' at approximately [339, 232]. This text is part of the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element. This action is expected to open a brightness slider or control, allowing the brightness to be adjusted. Actual Outcome: The last action, tapping on the \\'Brightness level\\' text at approximately [339, 232], did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Display\\' settings screen remains the same, and the \\'Brightness level\\' still indicates \\'0%\\'. No brightness slider, control, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to find and interact with the brightness control.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[350,65],\"end_point\":[350,398],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe horizontally from left to right across the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element. The element is located at bounding box [328, 55, 372, 408]. The swipe will start at [350, 65] and end at [350, 398]. This action attempts to interact with the element as if it were a slider to increase the screen brightness. Currently, the brightness level is displayed as \\'0%\\'. It is predicted that this swipe will increase the brightness, and the text \\'0%\\' will change to a higher value. Actual Outcome: The last action, a horizontal swipe from [350, 65] to [350, 398] across the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element (bounding box [328, 55, 372, 408]), did not result in any change to the screen brightness or UI. The \\'Brightness level\\' still shows \\'0%\\'. This action failed to adjust the brightness and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[350,232],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long press on the center of the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element, which is located at approximately [350, 232] (center of bounding box [328, 57, 372, 408]). This action is an attempt to reveal a brightness slider or other controls, as previous tap and swipe actions were unsuccessful. It is predicted that this long press might open a dialog, reveal a slider, or change the brightness value directly. Actual Outcome: The long press on the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element at approximately [350, 232] (center of bounding box [328, 57, 372, 408]) did not result in any visible change on the screen. The \\'Display\\' settings screen remains the same, the \\'Brightness level\\' still indicates \\'0%\\', and no brightness slider, control, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal. This marks another unsuccessful attempt to find and interact with the brightness control.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[350,174],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Brightness level\\' text, which is part of the \\'Brightness level 0%\\' element. The approximate coordinates for the tap are [350, 174], based on the bounding box [328, 55, 372, 408] for \\'Brightness level 0%\\'. This action is expected to open a brightness slider or a dialog allowing brightness adjustment. Actual Outcome: The last action was a tap on the settings icon in the top-left corner (coordinates of tap based on red ring). This caused the settings icon to change to a back arrow. However, the screen content (\"Display\" settings) did not change. No brightness slider, control, or pop-up appeared. Therefore, this action failed to bring the agent closer to adjusting the brightness and completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[288,139],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Brightness\\' label, located at approximately [288, 139] (center of bounding box [278, 54, 298, 225]). This action is expected to open a new screen or reveal a brightness slider, allowing the brightness to be adjusted.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
