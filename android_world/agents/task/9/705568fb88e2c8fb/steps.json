Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the quick settings panel, which should contain the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the quick settings panel. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction. The quick settings panel is now visible, and the next step is to find and interact with the brightness slider.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 1: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[250,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the middle of the screen (y=250, x=500) to the bottom of the screen (y=800, x=500) to fully expand the quick settings panel and reveal the brightness slider. The current screen shows the notification shade, but not the brightness slider.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

This action is expected to reveal the quick settings panel, which should contain the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the quick settings panel. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction. The quick settings panel is now visible, and the next step is to find and interact with the brightness slider.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[250,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the middle of the screen (y=250, x=500) to the bottom of the screen (y=800, x=500) to fully expand the quick settings panel and reveal the brightness slider. The current screen shows the notification shade, but not the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully expanded the quick settings panel. The panel is now fully visible, and the brightness slider should be accessible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 2: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[235,950],\"end_point\":[235,50],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe the brightness slider from right to left to set the brightness to its minimum value. The slider is located at y=235, and the swipe will be from x=950 to x=50. This action is based on the `BrightnessSliderLocation` stored in agent memory. The predicted outcome is that the screen brightness will decrease to the minimum level.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar.

The slider is located at y=235, and the swipe will be from x=950 to x=50. This action is based on the `BrightnessSliderLocation` stored in agent memory. The predicted outcome is that the screen brightness will decrease to the minimum level. Actual Outcome: The last action, swiping on the presumed brightness slider at y=235 (from x=950 to x=50), failed. The screen brightness did not change, and the visual appearance of the screen remained the same. This means the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible.

This action is expected to reveal the quick settings panel, which should contain the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the quick settings panel. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction. The quick settings panel is now visible, and the next step is to find and interact with the brightness slider.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[250,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the middle of the screen (y=250, x=500) to the bottom of the screen (y=800, x=500) to fully expand the quick settings panel and reveal the brightness slider. The current screen shows the notification shade, but not the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully expanded the quick settings panel. The panel is now fully visible, and the brightness slider should be accessible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[235,950],\"end_point\":[235,50],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe the brightness slider from right to left to set the brightness to its minimum value. The slider is located at y=235, and the swipe will be from x=950 to x=50. This action is based on the `BrightnessSliderLocation` stored in agent memory. The predicted outcome is that the screen brightness will decrease to the minimum level. Actual Outcome: The last action, swiping on the presumed brightness slider at y=235 (from x=950 to x=50), failed. The screen brightness did not change, and the visual appearance of the screen remained the same. This means the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The failure is attributed to the `BrightnessSliderLocation` in memory being incorrect; the coordinates [235, 50, 235, 950] point to the notification area, not a slider. The brightness slider needs to be correctly located before it can be manipulated.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the middle of the screen (y=300, x=500) to the bottom of the screen (y=800, x=500) to fully expand the quick settings panel. This action is intended to reveal the brightness slider, which is necessary to complete the user\\'s instruction. The current screen shows a partially expanded quick settings panel with notifications. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Quick Settings Panel\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The quick settings panel is visible on the screen, and the brightness slider is identifiable.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Swiped down from the top of the screen and successfully opened the quick settings panel.\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Set Brightness to Minimum\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The brightness slider has been moved to its leftmost position, indicating minimum brightness.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 4 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[50,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the top of the screen (y=50, x=500) to the middle of the screen (y=800, x=500) to open the quick settings panel. This action is expected to reveal the quick settings panel, which should contain the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the quick settings panel. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction. The quick settings panel is now visible, and the next step is to find and interact with the brightness slider.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[250,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the middle of the screen (y=250, x=500) to the bottom of the screen (y=800, x=500) to fully expand the quick settings panel and reveal the brightness slider. The current screen shows the notification shade, but not the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully expanded the quick settings panel. The panel is now fully visible, and the brightness slider should be accessible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[235,950],\"end_point\":[235,50],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe the brightness slider from right to left to set the brightness to its minimum value. The slider is located at y=235, and the swipe will be from x=950 to x=50. This action is based on the `BrightnessSliderLocation` stored in agent memory. The predicted outcome is that the screen brightness will decrease to the minimum level. Actual Outcome: The last action, swiping on the presumed brightness slider at y=235 (from x=950 to x=50), failed. The screen brightness did not change, and the visual appearance of the screen remained the same. This means the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The failure is attributed to the `BrightnessSliderLocation` in memory being incorrect; the coordinates [235, 50, 235, 950] point to the notification area, not a slider. The brightness slider needs to be correctly located before it can be manipulated.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the middle of the screen (y=300, x=500) to the bottom of the screen (y=800, x=500) to fully expand the quick settings panel. This action is intended to reveal the brightness slider, which is necessary to complete the user\\'s instruction. The current screen shows a partially expanded quick settings panel with notifications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300, 500] to [800, 500] failed to expand the quick settings panel. Instead, it interacted with the first notification, revealing \"Mark as read\" and \"Reply\" options. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the brightness slider remains hidden. The failure is likely due to the swipe\\'s start position or interpretation by the system.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the quick settings panel, which should contain the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the quick settings panel. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction. The quick settings panel is now visible, and the next step is to find and interact with the brightness slider.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[250,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the middle of the screen (y=250, x=500) to the bottom of the screen (y=800, x=500) to fully expand the quick settings panel and reveal the brightness slider. The current screen shows the notification shade, but not the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully expanded the quick settings panel. The panel is now fully visible, and the brightness slider should be accessible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[235,950],\"end_point\":[235,50],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe the brightness slider from right to left to set the brightness to its minimum value. The slider is located at y=235, and the swipe will be from x=950 to x=50. This action is based on the `BrightnessSliderLocation` stored in agent memory. The predicted outcome is that the screen brightness will decrease to the minimum level. Actual Outcome: The last action, swiping on the presumed brightness slider at y=235 (from x=950 to x=50), failed. The screen brightness did not change, and the visual appearance of the screen remained the same. This means the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The failure is attributed to the `BrightnessSliderLocation` in memory being incorrect; the coordinates [235, 50, 235, 950] point to the notification area, not a slider. The brightness slider needs to be correctly located before it can be manipulated.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the middle of the screen (y=300, x=500) to the bottom of the screen (y=800, x=500) to fully expand the quick settings panel. This action is intended to reveal the brightness slider, which is necessary to complete the user\\'s instruction. The current screen shows a partially expanded quick settings panel with notifications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300, 500] to [800, 500] failed to expand the quick settings panel. Instead, it interacted with the first notification, revealing \"Mark as read\" and \"Reply\" options. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the brightness slider remains hidden. The failure is likely due to the swipe\\'s start position or interpretation by the system.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[100,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the upper part of the quick settings panel (y=100, x=500) to a lower part of the screen (y=400, x=500) to fully expand the quick settings panel. This action is intended to reveal the brightness slider. The current screen shows a partially expanded quick settings panel.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The brightness slider needs to be correctly located before it can be manipulated.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the middle of the screen (y=300, x=500) to the bottom of the screen (y=800, x=500) to fully expand the quick settings panel. This action is intended to reveal the brightness slider, which is necessary to complete the user\\'s instruction. The current screen shows a partially expanded quick settings panel with notifications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300, 500] to [800, 500] failed to expand the quick settings panel. Instead, it interacted with the first notification, revealing \"Mark as read\" and \"Reply\" options. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the brightness slider remains hidden. The failure is likely due to the swipe\\'s start position or interpretation by the system.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[100,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the upper part of the quick settings panel (y=100, x=500) to a lower part of the screen (y=400, x=500) to fully expand the quick settings panel. This action is intended to reveal the brightness slider. The current screen shows a partially expanded quick settings panel. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [100, 500] to [400, 500] successfully expanded the quick settings panel. The panel is now fully visible, and a long horizontal element, which is likely the brightness slider, has appeared at the top of the panel. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the quick settings panel, which should contain the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the quick settings panel. This brings the agent closer to completing the user instruction. The quick settings panel is now visible, and the next step is to find and interact with the brightness slider.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[250,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the middle of the screen (y=250, x=500) to the bottom of the screen (y=800, x=500) to fully expand the quick settings panel and reveal the brightness slider. The current screen shows the notification shade, but not the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully expanded the quick settings panel. The panel is now fully visible, and the brightness slider should be accessible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[235,950],\"end_point\":[235,50],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe the brightness slider from right to left to set the brightness to its minimum value. The slider is located at y=235, and the swipe will be from x=950 to x=50. This action is based on the `BrightnessSliderLocation` stored in agent memory. The predicted outcome is that the screen brightness will decrease to the minimum level. Actual Outcome: The last action, swiping on the presumed brightness slider at y=235 (from x=950 to x=50), failed. The screen brightness did not change, and the visual appearance of the screen remained the same. This means the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The failure is attributed to the `BrightnessSliderLocation` in memory being incorrect; the coordinates [235, 50, 235, 950] point to the notification area, not a slider. The brightness slider needs to be correctly located before it can be manipulated.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the middle of the screen (y=300, x=500) to the bottom of the screen (y=800, x=500) to fully expand the quick settings panel. This action is intended to reveal the brightness slider, which is necessary to complete the user\\'s instruction. The current screen shows a partially expanded quick settings panel with notifications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300, 500] to [800, 500] failed to expand the quick settings panel. Instead, it interacted with the first notification, revealing \"Mark as read\" and \"Reply\" options. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the brightness slider remains hidden. The failure is likely due to the swipe\\'s start position or interpretation by the system.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[100,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the upper part of the quick settings panel (y=100, x=500) to a lower part of the screen (y=400, x=500) to fully expand the quick settings panel. This action is intended to reveal the brightness slider. The current screen shows a partially expanded quick settings panel. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [100, 500] to [400, 500] successfully expanded the quick settings panel. The panel is now fully visible, and a long horizontal element, which is likely the brightness slider, has appeared at the top of the panel. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[170,950],\"end_point\":[170,50],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe the brightness slider from right to left to set the brightness to its minimum value. The slider is located at y=170, and the swipe will be from x=950 to x=50. This action is based on the `BrightnessSliderLocation` stored in agent memory and visual confirmation from the screenshot. The predicted outcome is that the screen brightness will decrease to the minimum level. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Quick Settings Panel\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The quick settings panel is visible on the screen, and the brightness slider is identifiable.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Swiped down from the top of the screen and successfully opened the quick settings panel.\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Set Brightness to Minimum\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The brightness slider has been moved to its leftmost position, indicating minimum brightness.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current screen shows the notification shade, but not the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully expanded the quick settings panel. The panel is now fully visible, and the brightness slider should be accessible. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[235,950],\"end_point\":[235,50],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe the brightness slider from right to left to set the brightness to its minimum value. The slider is located at y=235, and the swipe will be from x=950 to x=50. This action is based on the `BrightnessSliderLocation` stored in agent memory. The predicted outcome is that the screen brightness will decrease to the minimum level. Actual Outcome: The last action, swiping on the presumed brightness slider at y=235 (from x=950 to x=50), failed. The screen brightness did not change, and the visual appearance of the screen remained the same. This means the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The failure is attributed to the `BrightnessSliderLocation` in memory being incorrect; the coordinates [235, 50, 235, 950] point to the notification area, not a slider. The brightness slider needs to be correctly located before it can be manipulated.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the middle of the screen (y=300, x=500) to the bottom of the screen (y=800, x=500) to fully expand the quick settings panel. This action is intended to reveal the brightness slider, which is necessary to complete the user\\'s instruction. The current screen shows a partially expanded quick settings panel with notifications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300, 500] to [800, 500] failed to expand the quick settings panel. Instead, it interacted with the first notification, revealing \"Mark as read\" and \"Reply\" options. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the brightness slider remains hidden. The failure is likely due to the swipe\\'s start position or interpretation by the system.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[100,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the upper part of the quick settings panel (y=100, x=500) to a lower part of the screen (y=400, x=500) to fully expand the quick settings panel. This action is intended to reveal the brightness slider. The current screen shows a partially expanded quick settings panel. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [100, 500] to [400, 500] successfully expanded the quick settings panel. The panel is now fully visible, and a long horizontal element, which is likely the brightness slider, has appeared at the top of the panel. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[170,950],\"end_point\":[170,50],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe the brightness slider from right to left to set the brightness to its minimum value. The slider is located at y=170, and the swipe will be from x=950 to x=50. This action is based on the `BrightnessSliderLocation` stored in agent memory and visual confirmation from the screenshot. The predicted outcome is that the screen brightness will decrease to the minimum level. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the presumed brightness slider at y=170 (from x=950 to x=50) failed. The screen brightness did not change, and the visual state of the quick settings panel remained the same. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[170,950],\"end_point\":[170,50],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Retry swiping the brightness slider from its rightmost point ([170, 950]) to its leftmost point ([170, 50]) to set the screen brightness to the minimum value. The slider is currently visible at the top of the quick settings panel. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Quick Settings Panel\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The quick settings panel is visible on the screen, and the brightness slider is identifiable.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Swiped down from the top of the screen and successfully opened the quick settings panel.\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Set Brightness to Minimum\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The brightness slider has been moved to its leftmost position, indicating minimum brightness.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The slider is located at y=235, and the swipe will be from x=950 to x=50. This action is based on the `BrightnessSliderLocation` stored in agent memory. The predicted outcome is that the screen brightness will decrease to the minimum level. Actual Outcome: The last action, swiping on the presumed brightness slider at y=235 (from x=950 to x=50), failed. The screen brightness did not change, and the visual appearance of the screen remained the same. This means the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The failure is attributed to the `BrightnessSliderLocation` in memory being incorrect; the coordinates [235, 50, 235, 950] point to the notification area, not a slider. The brightness slider needs to be correctly located before it can be manipulated.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[300,500],\"end_point\":[800,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the middle of the screen (y=300, x=500) to the bottom of the screen (y=800, x=500) to fully expand the quick settings panel. This action is intended to reveal the brightness slider, which is necessary to complete the user\\'s instruction. The current screen shows a partially expanded quick settings panel with notifications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300, 500] to [800, 500] failed to expand the quick settings panel. Instead, it interacted with the first notification, revealing \"Mark as read\" and \"Reply\" options. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the brightness slider remains hidden. The failure is likely due to the swipe\\'s start position or interpretation by the system.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[100,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the upper part of the quick settings panel (y=100, x=500) to a lower part of the screen (y=400, x=500) to fully expand the quick settings panel. This action is intended to reveal the brightness slider. The current screen shows a partially expanded quick settings panel. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [100, 500] to [400, 500] successfully expanded the quick settings panel. The panel is now fully visible, and a long horizontal element, which is likely the brightness slider, has appeared at the top of the panel. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[170,950],\"end_point\":[170,50],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe the brightness slider from right to left to set the brightness to its minimum value. The slider is located at y=170, and the swipe will be from x=950 to x=50. This action is based on the `BrightnessSliderLocation` stored in agent memory and visual confirmation from the screenshot. The predicted outcome is that the screen brightness will decrease to the minimum level. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the presumed brightness slider at y=170 (from x=950 to x=50) failed. The screen brightness did not change, and the visual state of the quick settings panel remained the same. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[170,950],\"end_point\":[170,50],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Retry swiping the brightness slider from its rightmost point ([170, 950]) to its leftmost point ([170, 50]) to set the screen brightness to the minimum value. The slider is currently visible at the top of the quick settings panel. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the presumed brightness slider at y=170 (from x=950 to x=50) failed. Instead of changing the brightness, it triggered a \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" error dialog. The screen brightness did not change, and the quick settings panel is no longer visible. This action was a failure and moved the agent further from completing the subgoal, as an error needs to be handled first.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Wait\" button in the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The button is located at approximately `[580, 300]`. This action is intended to dismiss the error dialog and allow the system to recover. The predicted outcome is that the dialog will disappear, and the system will return to a responsive state, hopefully with the quick settings panel still visible. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Quick Settings Panel\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The quick settings panel is visible on the screen, and the brightness slider is identifiable.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Swiped down from the top of the screen and successfully opened the quick settings panel.\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Set Brightness to Minimum\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The brightness slider has been moved to its leftmost position, indicating minimum brightness.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Wait\" button (located near [580, 300]) successfully dismissed the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The screen now displays the notification list, and the quick settings panel is closed. This action resolved the immediate error, allowing the agent to continue with the task, but it did not directly progress towards setting the brightness, as the relevant UI (quick settings panel) is no longer visible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to reveal the brightness slider, which is necessary to complete the user\\'s instruction. The current screen shows a partially expanded quick settings panel with notifications. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [300, 500] to [800, 500] failed to expand the quick settings panel. Instead, it interacted with the first notification, revealing \"Mark as read\" and \"Reply\" options. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the brightness slider remains hidden. The failure is likely due to the swipe\\'s start position or interpretation by the system.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[100,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the upper part of the quick settings panel (y=100, x=500) to a lower part of the screen (y=400, x=500) to fully expand the quick settings panel. This action is intended to reveal the brightness slider. The current screen shows a partially expanded quick settings panel. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [100, 500] to [400, 500] successfully expanded the quick settings panel. The panel is now fully visible, and a long horizontal element, which is likely the brightness slider, has appeared at the top of the panel. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[170,950],\"end_point\":[170,50],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe the brightness slider from right to left to set the brightness to its minimum value. The slider is located at y=170, and the swipe will be from x=950 to x=50. This action is based on the `BrightnessSliderLocation` stored in agent memory and visual confirmation from the screenshot. The predicted outcome is that the screen brightness will decrease to the minimum level. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the presumed brightness slider at y=170 (from x=950 to x=50) failed. The screen brightness did not change, and the visual state of the quick settings panel remained the same. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[170,950],\"end_point\":[170,50],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Retry swiping the brightness slider from its rightmost point ([170, 950]) to its leftmost point ([170, 50]) to set the screen brightness to the minimum value. The slider is currently visible at the top of the quick settings panel. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the presumed brightness slider at y=170 (from x=950 to x=50) failed. Instead of changing the brightness, it triggered a \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" error dialog. The screen brightness did not change, and the quick settings panel is no longer visible. This action was a failure and moved the agent further from completing the subgoal, as an error needs to be handled first.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Wait\" button in the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The button is located at approximately `[580, 300]`. This action is intended to dismiss the error dialog and allow the system to recover. The predicted outcome is that the dialog will disappear, and the system will return to a responsive state, hopefully with the quick settings panel still visible. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Wait\" button (located near [580, 300]) successfully dismissed the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The screen now displays the notification list, and the quick settings panel is closed. This action resolved the immediate error, allowing the agent to continue with the task, but it did not directly progress towards setting the brightness, as the relevant UI (quick settings panel) is no longer visible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[50,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the top of the screen (y=50, x=500) to a lower position (y=400, x=500) to open the quick settings panel. The current screen shows a list of notifications. The predicted outcome is that the quick settings panel will open, revealing the brightness slider.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 99, 503], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / JdX: 0.0 Lal: 8,4020 [Xv: 0.0 7541\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 674], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.840\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 813, 87, 956], \\'text\\': \\'T-Mobile\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [111, 35, 128, 219], \\'text\\': \\'Sun, Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [111, 874, 127, 965], \\'text\\': \\'100%\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [245, 148, 281, 333], \\'text\\': \\'Internet AndroidWifi\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [244, 618, 261, 775], \\'text\\': \\'Bluetooth\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [267, 620, 282, 667], \\'text\\': \\'On\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [340, 145, 380, 377], \\'text\\': \\'Flashlight Camera in use\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [340, 620, 357, 852], \\'text\\': \\'Do Not Disturb\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [362, 618, 377, 675], \\'text\\': \\'Off\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [461, 119, 487, 752], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \"Process system isn\\\\\\'t responding\"}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [519, 256, 540, 435], \\'text\\': \\'Close app\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [572, 259, 588, 341], \\'text\\': \\'Wait\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [316, 507, 405, 965]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [220, 507, 307, 963]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [921, 859, 967, 967]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [921, 742, 967, 849]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [247, 398, 284, 478]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [157, 867, 197, 940]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [557, 103, 609, 201]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is intended to reveal the brightness slider. The current screen shows a partially expanded quick settings panel. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [100, 500] to [400, 500] successfully expanded the quick settings panel. The panel is now fully visible, and a long horizontal element, which is likely the brightness slider, has appeared at the top of the panel. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[170,950],\"end_point\":[170,50],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe the brightness slider from right to left to set the brightness to its minimum value. The slider is located at y=170, and the swipe will be from x=950 to x=50. This action is based on the `BrightnessSliderLocation` stored in agent memory and visual confirmation from the screenshot. The predicted outcome is that the screen brightness will decrease to the minimum level. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the presumed brightness slider at y=170 (from x=950 to x=50) failed. The screen brightness did not change, and the visual state of the quick settings panel remained the same. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[170,950],\"end_point\":[170,50],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Retry swiping the brightness slider from its rightmost point ([170, 950]) to its leftmost point ([170, 50]) to set the screen brightness to the minimum value. The slider is currently visible at the top of the quick settings panel. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the presumed brightness slider at y=170 (from x=950 to x=50) failed. Instead of changing the brightness, it triggered a \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" error dialog. The screen brightness did not change, and the quick settings panel is no longer visible. This action was a failure and moved the agent further from completing the subgoal, as an error needs to be handled first.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The button is located at approximately `[580, 300]`. This action is intended to dismiss the error dialog and allow the system to recover. The predicted outcome is that the dialog will disappear, and the system will return to a responsive state, hopefully with the quick settings panel still visible. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Wait\" button (located near [580, 300]) successfully dismissed the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The screen now displays the notification list, and the quick settings panel is closed. This action resolved the immediate error, allowing the agent to continue with the task, but it did not directly progress towards setting the brightness, as the relevant UI (quick settings panel) is no longer visible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[50,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the top of the screen (y=50, x=500) to a lower position (y=400, x=500) to open the quick settings panel. The current screen shows a list of notifications. The predicted outcome is that the quick settings panel will open, revealing the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [50, 500] to [400, 500] failed to open the quick settings panel. Instead, it triggered a \\'Process system isn\\'t responding\\' dialog. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; in fact, it reintroduced an error state that needs to be resolved before further progress can be made.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The slider is located at y=170, and the swipe will be from x=950 to x=50. This action is based on the `BrightnessSliderLocation` stored in agent memory and visual confirmation from the screenshot. The predicted outcome is that the screen brightness will decrease to the minimum level. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the presumed brightness slider at y=170 (from x=950 to x=50) failed. The screen brightness did not change, and the visual state of the quick settings panel remained the same. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[170,950],\"end_point\":[170,50],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Retry swiping the brightness slider from its rightmost point ([170, 950]) to its leftmost point ([170, 50]) to set the screen brightness to the minimum value. The slider is currently visible at the top of the quick settings panel. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the presumed brightness slider at y=170 (from x=950 to x=50) failed. Instead of changing the brightness, it triggered a \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" error dialog. The screen brightness did not change, and the quick settings panel is no longer visible. This action was a failure and moved the agent further from completing the subgoal, as an error needs to be handled first.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Wait\" button in the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The button is located at approximately `[580, 300]`. This action is intended to dismiss the error dialog and allow the system to recover. The predicted outcome is that the dialog will disappear, and the system will return to a responsive state, hopefully with the quick settings panel still visible. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Wait\" button (located near [580, 300]) successfully dismissed the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The screen now displays the notification list, and the quick settings panel is closed. This action resolved the immediate error, allowing the agent to continue with the task, but it did not directly progress towards setting the brightness, as the relevant UI (quick settings panel) is no longer visible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[50,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the top of the screen (y=50, x=500) to a lower position (y=400, x=500) to open the quick settings panel. The current screen shows a list of notifications. The predicted outcome is that the quick settings panel will open, revealing the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [50, 500] to [400, 500] failed to open the quick settings panel. Instead, it triggered a \\'Process system isn\\'t responding\\' dialog. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; in fact, it reintroduced an error state that needs to be resolved before further progress can be made.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[530,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Close app\" button in the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The button is located around [530, 345]. This action is intended to close the unresponsive process and hopefully stabilize the system. The predicted outcome is that the dialog will disappear, and the system will return to a responsive state, allowing further attempts to open the quick settings panel. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Close app\" button (located near [530, 345]) successfully dismissed the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The screen now displays a partially expanded quick settings panel. This action resolved the immediate error, allowing the agent to continue with the task. It brought the agent closer to the goal by removing the blocking error and returning to a state where the quick settings panel is accessible, albeit not yet fully expanded.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[50,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the top-middle of the screen ([50, 500]) to a lower position ([400, 500]) to fully expand the quick settings panel. The panel is currently partially open. The predicted outcome is that the quick settings panel will fully expand, revealing the brightness slider.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

The slider is currently visible at the top of the quick settings panel. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the presumed brightness slider at y=170 (from x=950 to x=50) failed. Instead of changing the brightness, it triggered a \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" error dialog. The screen brightness did not change, and the quick settings panel is no longer visible.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Wait\" button in the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The button is located at approximately `[580, 300]`. This action is intended to dismiss the error dialog and allow the system to recover. The predicted outcome is that the dialog will disappear, and the system will return to a responsive state, hopefully with the quick settings panel still visible. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Wait\" button (located near [580, 300]) successfully dismissed the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The screen now displays the notification list, and the quick settings panel is closed. This action resolved the immediate error, allowing the agent to continue with the task, but it did not directly progress towards setting the brightness, as the relevant UI (quick settings panel) is no longer visible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[50,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the top of the screen (y=50, x=500) to a lower position (y=400, x=500) to open the quick settings panel. The current screen shows a list of notifications. The predicted outcome is that the quick settings panel will open, revealing the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [50, 500] to [400, 500] failed to open the quick settings panel. Instead, it triggered a \\'Process system isn\\'t responding\\' dialog. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; in fact, it reintroduced an error state that needs to be resolved before further progress can be made.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[530,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Close app\" button in the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The button is located around [530, 345]. This action is intended to close the unresponsive process and hopefully stabilize the system. The predicted outcome is that the dialog will disappear, and the system will return to a responsive state, allowing further attempts to open the quick settings panel. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Close app\" button (located near [530, 345]) successfully dismissed the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The screen now displays a partially expanded quick settings panel. This action resolved the immediate error, allowing the agent to continue with the task. It brought the agent closer to the goal by removing the blocking error and returning to a state where the quick settings panel is accessible, albeit not yet fully expanded.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[50,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the top-middle of the screen ([50, 500]) to a lower position ([400, 500]) to fully expand the quick settings panel. The panel is currently partially open. The predicted outcome is that the quick settings panel will fully expand, revealing the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [50, 500] to [400, 500] successfully fully expanded the quick settings panel. The presumed brightness slider is now visible at the top of the panel, around y=170. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the brightness slider accessible for interaction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The slider is currently visible at the top of the quick settings panel. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the presumed brightness slider at y=170 (from x=950 to x=50) failed. Instead of changing the brightness, it triggered a \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" error dialog. The screen brightness did not change, and the quick settings panel is no longer visible. This action was a failure and moved the agent further from completing the subgoal, as an error needs to be handled first.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Wait\" button in the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The button is located at approximately `[580, 300]`. This action is intended to dismiss the error dialog and allow the system to recover. The predicted outcome is that the dialog will disappear, and the system will return to a responsive state, hopefully with the quick settings panel still visible. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Wait\" button (located near [580, 300]) successfully dismissed the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The screen now displays the notification list, and the quick settings panel is closed. This action resolved the immediate error, allowing the agent to continue with the task, but it did not directly progress towards setting the brightness, as the relevant UI (quick settings panel) is no longer visible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[50,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the top of the screen (y=50, x=500) to a lower position (y=400, x=500) to open the quick settings panel. The current screen shows a list of notifications. The predicted outcome is that the quick settings panel will open, revealing the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [50, 500] to [400, 500] failed to open the quick settings panel. Instead, it triggered a \\'Process system isn\\'t responding\\' dialog. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; in fact, it reintroduced an error state that needs to be resolved before further progress can be made.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[530,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Close app\" button in the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The button is located around [530, 345]. This action is intended to close the unresponsive process and hopefully stabilize the system. The predicted outcome is that the dialog will disappear, and the system will return to a responsive state, allowing further attempts to open the quick settings panel. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Close app\" button (located near [530, 345]) successfully dismissed the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The screen now displays a partially expanded quick settings panel. This action resolved the immediate error, allowing the agent to continue with the task. It brought the agent closer to the goal by removing the blocking error and returning to a state where the quick settings panel is accessible, albeit not yet fully expanded.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[50,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the top-middle of the screen ([50, 500]) to a lower position ([400, 500]) to fully expand the quick settings panel. The panel is currently partially open. The predicted outcome is that the quick settings panel will fully expand, revealing the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [50, 500] to [400, 500] successfully fully expanded the quick settings panel. The presumed brightness slider is now visible at the top of the panel, around y=170. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the brightness slider accessible for interaction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[170,950],\"end_point\":[170,50],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe the brightness slider, located at y=170, from its rightmost point ([170, 950]) to its leftmost point ([170, 50]) to set the screen brightness to the minimum value. The slider is currently visible at the top of the fully expanded quick settings panel. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Quick Settings Panel\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The quick settings panel is visible on the screen, and the brightness slider is identifiable.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Swiped down from the top of the screen and successfully opened the quick settings panel.\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Set Brightness to Minimum\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The brightness slider has been moved to its leftmost position, indicating minimum brightness.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
        "response": "{'ScreenshotDifferenceObservation': 'The screenshots before and after the action are almost identical. The time changed from 15:42 to 15:43. The content of the quick settings panel, including the presumed brightness slider at y=170, remains unchanged. This indicates that the swipe action on the presumed brightness slider did not have any effect on the screen brightness or the UI elements.', 'StepByStepExplanation': 'The last action was to swipe the presumed brightness slider from right to left ([170, 950] to [170, 50]). The screenshots show no change in the brightness or the position of the slider, meaning the action failed. This is the third attempt to interact with this element as a slider, and all attempts have failed. The previous attempts also did not change the brightness, and one of them even caused a \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" error. Given the repeated failures, it\\'s highly probable that the element at y=170 is not a brightness slider, or it\\'s not interactive via swipe in this context.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Wait\" button in the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The button is located at approximately `[580, 300]`. This action is intended to dismiss the error dialog and allow the system to recover. The predicted outcome is that the dialog will disappear, and the system will return to a responsive state, hopefully with the quick settings panel still visible. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Wait\" button (located near [580, 300]) successfully dismissed the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The screen now displays the notification list, and the quick settings panel is closed. This action resolved the immediate error, allowing the agent to continue with the task, but it did not directly progress towards setting the brightness, as the relevant UI (quick settings panel) is no longer visible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[50,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the top of the screen (y=50, x=500) to a lower position (y=400, x=500) to open the quick settings panel. The current screen shows a list of notifications. The predicted outcome is that the quick settings panel will open, revealing the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [50, 500] to [400, 500] failed to open the quick settings panel. Instead, it triggered a \\'Process system isn\\'t responding\\' dialog. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; in fact, it reintroduced an error state that needs to be resolved before further progress can be made.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[530,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Close app\" button in the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The button is located around [530, 345]. This action is intended to close the unresponsive process and hopefully stabilize the system. The predicted outcome is that the dialog will disappear, and the system will return to a responsive state, allowing further attempts to open the quick settings panel. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Close app\" button (located near [530, 345]) successfully dismissed the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The screen now displays a partially expanded quick settings panel. This action resolved the immediate error, allowing the agent to continue with the task. It brought the agent closer to the goal by removing the blocking error and returning to a state where the quick settings panel is accessible, albeit not yet fully expanded.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[50,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the top-middle of the screen ([50, 500]) to a lower position ([400, 500]) to fully expand the quick settings panel. The panel is currently partially open. The predicted outcome is that the quick settings panel will fully expand, revealing the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [50, 500] to [400, 500] successfully fully expanded the quick settings panel. The presumed brightness slider is now visible at the top of the panel, around y=170. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the brightness slider accessible for interaction.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[170,950],\"end_point\":[170,50],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe the brightness slider, located at y=170, from its rightmost point ([170, 950]) to its leftmost point ([170, 50]) to set the screen brightness to the minimum value. The slider is currently visible at the top of the fully expanded quick settings panel. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the presumed brightness slider at y=170 (from [170, 950] to [170, 50]) failed. The screen brightness did not change, and the quick settings panel remained in the same state. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failures to interact with this element suggest it is not a functional brightness slider or is unresponsive. The next step should be to try adjusting brightness through the main Settings app by tapping the settings icon in the quick settings panel.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 0, 98, 375], \\'text\\': \\'P:1 / X: 444.7 408.0 15243\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 537], \\'text\\': \\'JXv: -0.972\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'[Prs: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 813, 87, 956], \\'text\\': \\'T-Mobile\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [111, 35, 128, 219], \\'text\\': \\'Sun, Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [111, 874, 127, 965], \\'text\\': \\'100%\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [245, 148, 282, 334], \\'text\\': \\'Internet AndroidWifi\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [244, 618, 261, 775], \\'text\\': \\'Bluetooth\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [267, 620, 282, 667], \\'text\\': \\'On\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [340, 147, 378, 376], \\'text\\': \\'Flashlight Camera in use\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [340, 618, 377, 852], \\'text\\': \\'Do Not Disturb Off\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [438, 151, 452, 247], \\'text\\': \\'Alarm\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [436, 617, 474, 853], \\'text\\': \\'Airplane mode Off\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [458, 150, 474, 354], \\'text\\': \\'No alarm set\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [533, 148, 571, 393], \\'text\\': \\'Device controls Unavailable\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [534, 622, 549, 800], \\'text\\': \\'Auto-rotate\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [555, 620, 570, 667], \\'text\\': \\'On\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [316, 505, 404, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [412, 35, 501, 492]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [509, 502, 596, 972]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [316, 35, 403, 491]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [508, 33, 597, 494]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [220, 502, 307, 973]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [921, 860, 966, 966]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [921, 742, 966, 849]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [160, 870, 193, 938]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [61, 1, 171, 415]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [105, 752, 131, 835]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,300],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Wait\" button in the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The button is located at approximately `[580, 300]`. This action is intended to dismiss the error dialog and allow the system to recover. The predicted outcome is that the dialog will disappear, and the system will return to a responsive state, hopefully with the quick settings panel still visible. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Wait\" button (located near [580, 300]) successfully dismissed the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The screen now displays the notification list, and the quick settings panel is closed. This action resolved the immediate error, allowing the agent to continue with the task, but it did not directly progress towards setting the brightness, as the relevant UI (quick settings panel) is no longer visible.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[50,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the top of the screen (y=50, x=500) to a lower position (y=400, x=500) to open the quick settings panel. The current screen shows a list of notifications. The predicted outcome is that the quick settings panel will open, revealing the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [50, 500] to [400, 500] failed to open the quick settings panel. Instead, it triggered a \\'Process system isn\\'t responding\\' dialog. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; in fact, it reintroduced an error state that needs to be resolved before further progress can be made.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[530,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Close app\" button in the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The button is located around [530, 345]. This action is intended to close the unresponsive process and hopefully stabilize the system. The predicted outcome is that the dialog will disappear, and the system will return to a responsive state, allowing further attempts to open the quick settings panel. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Close app\" button (located near [530, 345]) successfully dismissed the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The screen now displays a partially expanded quick settings panel. This action resolved the immediate error, allowing the agent to continue with the task. It brought the agent closer to the goal by removing the blocking error and returning to a state where the quick settings panel is accessible, albeit not yet fully expanded.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[50,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the top-middle of the screen ([50, 500]) to a lower position ([400, 500]) to fully expand the quick settings panel. The panel is currently partially open. The predicted outcome is that the quick settings panel will fully expand, revealing the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [50, 500] to [400, 500] successfully fully expanded the quick settings panel. The presumed brightness slider is now visible at the top of the panel, around y=170. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the brightness slider accessible for interaction.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[170,950],\"end_point\":[170,50],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe the brightness slider, located at y=170, from its rightmost point ([170, 950]) to its leftmost point ([170, 50]) to set the screen brightness to the minimum value. The slider is currently visible at the top of the fully expanded quick settings panel. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the presumed brightness slider at y=170 (from [170, 950] to [170, 50]) failed. The screen brightness did not change, and the quick settings panel remained in the same state. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failures to interact with this element suggest it is not a functional brightness slider or is unresponsive. The next step should be to try adjusting brightness through the main Settings app by tapping the settings icon in the quick settings panel.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[944,795],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the settings icon (gear icon) located at the bottom right of the quick settings panel, near [944, 795]. This action is intended to open the main Settings app. The predicted outcome is that the Settings app will open, allowing navigation to the Display settings to adjust the brightness. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Quick Settings Panel\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The quick settings panel is visible on the screen, and the brightness slider is identifiable.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Swiped down from the top of the screen and successfully opened the quick settings panel.\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Set Brightness to Minimum\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The brightness slider has been moved to its leftmost position, indicating minimum brightness.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider.

The current screen shows a list of notifications. The predicted outcome is that the quick settings panel will open, revealing the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [50, 500] to [400, 500] failed to open the quick settings panel. Instead, it triggered a \\'Process system isn\\'t responding\\' dialog. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; in fact, it reintroduced an error state that needs to be resolved before further progress can be made.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[530,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Close app\" button in the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The button is located around [530, 345]. This action is intended to close the unresponsive process and hopefully stabilize the system. The predicted outcome is that the dialog will disappear, and the system will return to a responsive state, allowing further attempts to open the quick settings panel. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Close app\" button (located near [530, 345]) successfully dismissed the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The screen now displays a partially expanded quick settings panel. This action resolved the immediate error, allowing the agent to continue with the task. It brought the agent closer to the goal by removing the blocking error and returning to a state where the quick settings panel is accessible, albeit not yet fully expanded.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[50,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the top-middle of the screen ([50, 500]) to a lower position ([400, 500]) to fully expand the quick settings panel. The panel is currently partially open. The predicted outcome is that the quick settings panel will fully expand, revealing the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [50, 500] to [400, 500] successfully fully expanded the quick settings panel. The presumed brightness slider is now visible at the top of the panel, around y=170. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the brightness slider accessible for interaction.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[170,950],\"end_point\":[170,50],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe the brightness slider, located at y=170, from its rightmost point ([170, 950]) to its leftmost point ([170, 50]) to set the screen brightness to the minimum value. The slider is currently visible at the top of the fully expanded quick settings panel. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the presumed brightness slider at y=170 (from [170, 950] to [170, 50]) failed. The screen brightness did not change, and the quick settings panel remained in the same state. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failures to interact with this element suggest it is not a functional brightness slider or is unresponsive. The next step should be to try adjusting brightness through the main Settings app by tapping the settings icon in the quick settings panel.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[944,795],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the settings icon (gear icon) located at the bottom right of the quick settings panel, near [944, 795]. This action is intended to open the main Settings app. The predicted outcome is that the Settings app will open, allowing navigation to the Display settings to adjust the brightness. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [944, 795] did not open the Settings app. Instead, the quick settings panel closed, and the screen now shows the notification list. The action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the quick settings panel needs to be reopened, and the settings icon needs to be tapped with more accurate coordinates.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

The current screen shows a list of notifications. The predicted outcome is that the quick settings panel will open, revealing the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [50, 500] to [400, 500] failed to open the quick settings panel. Instead, it triggered a \\'Process system isn\\'t responding\\' dialog. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal; in fact, it reintroduced an error state that needs to be resolved before further progress can be made.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[530,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \"Close app\" button in the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The button is located around [530, 345]. This action is intended to close the unresponsive process and hopefully stabilize the system. The predicted outcome is that the dialog will disappear, and the system will return to a responsive state, allowing further attempts to open the quick settings panel. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \"Close app\" button (located near [530, 345]) successfully dismissed the \"Process system isn\\'t responding\" dialog. The screen now displays a partially expanded quick settings panel. This action resolved the immediate error, allowing the agent to continue with the task. It brought the agent closer to the goal by removing the blocking error and returning to a state where the quick settings panel is accessible, albeit not yet fully expanded.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[50,500],\"end_point\":[400,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the top-middle of the screen ([50, 500]) to a lower position ([400, 500]) to fully expand the quick settings panel. The panel is currently partially open. The predicted outcome is that the quick settings panel will fully expand, revealing the brightness slider. Actual Outcome: The swipe action from [50, 500] to [400, 500] successfully fully expanded the quick settings panel. The presumed brightness slider is now visible at the top of the panel, around y=170. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the brightness slider accessible for interaction.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[170,950],\"end_point\":[170,50],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe the brightness slider, located at y=170, from its rightmost point ([170, 950]) to its leftmost point ([170, 50]) to set the screen brightness to the minimum value. The slider is currently visible at the top of the fully expanded quick settings panel. Actual Outcome: The swipe action on the presumed brightness slider at y=170 (from [170, 950] to [170, 50]) failed. The screen brightness did not change, and the quick settings panel remained in the same state. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. The repeated failures to interact with this element suggest it is not a functional brightness slider or is unresponsive. The next step should be to try adjusting brightness through the main Settings app by tapping the settings icon in the quick settings panel.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[944,795],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the settings icon (gear icon) located at the bottom right of the quick settings panel, near [944, 795]. This action is intended to open the main Settings app. The predicted outcome is that the Settings app will open, allowing navigation to the Display settings to adjust the brightness. Actual Outcome: The tap action at [944, 795] did not open the Settings app. Instead, the quick settings panel closed, and the screen now shows the notification list. The action was a failure and did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal. To correct this, the quick settings panel needs to be reopened, and the settings icon needs to be tapped with more accurate coordinates.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 13: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[50,500],\"end_point\":[250,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe down from the top-middle of the screen (from [50, 500] to [250, 500]) to open the quick settings panel partially. The current screen shows a list of notifications. The predicted outcome is that the quick settings panel will open partially. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open Quick Settings Panel\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The quick settings panel is visible on the screen, and the brightness slider is identifiable.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Swiped down from the top of the screen and successfully opened the quick settings panel.\",\"PlannedNextSteps\":[],\"status\":\"completed\"},{\"ID\":2,\"Title\":\"Set Brightness to Minimum\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The brightness slider has been moved to its leftmost position, indicating minimum brightness.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
