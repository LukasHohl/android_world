Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 796, 34, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 712, 65, 797], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 46, 147, 306], \\'text\\': \\'Sun; Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 336, 722, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Gmail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 561, 722, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [704, 781, 722, 921], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [784, 546, 854, 691], \\'text\\': \\'9\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 72, 855, 233]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 299, 856, 464]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 766, 856, 929]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 535, 857, 705]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 536, 729, 694]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 764, 728, 927]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 299, 731, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 701, 948, 795]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 251, 37, 295]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 196, 36, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [893, 802, 952, 921]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 116, 37, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 792, 38, 946]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

This action is predicted to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the VLC app can then be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the VLC app. Since VLC is not immediately visible, the next step involves scrolling through the app drawer.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This should reveal more apps, hopefully including VLC. The current screen shows a list of apps, and VLC is not visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer down, revealing more applications. The \\'VLC\\' application icon is now visible on the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the VLC app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 2: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

This action is predicted to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the VLC app can then be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the VLC app. Since VLC is not immediately visible, the next step involves scrolling through the app drawer.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This should reveal more apps, hopefully including VLC. The current screen shows a list of apps, and VLC is not visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer down, revealing more applications. The \\'VLC\\' application icon is now visible on the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the VLC app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[781,844],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLC\\' app icon, which is an orange traffic cone located in the bottom right quadrant of the screen, at approximately [781, 844]. This action is predicted to open the VLC application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the VLC app icon was successful. The VLC application launched and is now displayed on the screen, showing its \\'Browse\\' tab. This completes the first subgoal of opening the VLC app.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

This action is predicted to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the VLC app can then be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the VLC app. Since VLC is not immediately visible, the next step involves scrolling through the app drawer.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This should reveal more apps, hopefully including VLC. The current screen shows a list of apps, and VLC is not visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer down, revealing more applications. The \\'VLC\\' application icon is now visible on the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the VLC app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[781,844],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLC\\' app icon, which is an orange traffic cone located in the bottom right quadrant of the screen, at approximately [781, 844]. This action is predicted to open the VLC application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the VLC app icon was successful. The VLC application launched and is now displayed on the screen, showing its \\'Browse\\' tab. This completes the first subgoal of opening the VLC app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[960,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab located at the bottom of the screen, with text \\'Playlists\\' at approximately [960, 700]. This action is predicted to switch the view to the Playlists section of the VLC app. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The VLC application is open, and its main interface is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16.

This action is predicted to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the VLC app can then be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the VLC app. Since VLC is not immediately visible, the next step involves scrolling through the app drawer.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This should reveal more apps, hopefully including VLC. The current screen shows a list of apps, and VLC is not visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer down, revealing more applications. The \\'VLC\\' application icon is now visible on the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the VLC app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[781,844],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLC\\' app icon, which is an orange traffic cone located in the bottom right quadrant of the screen, at approximately [781, 844]. This action is predicted to open the VLC application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the VLC app icon was successful. The VLC application launched and is now displayed on the screen, showing its \\'Browse\\' tab. This completes the first subgoal of opening the VLC app.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[960,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab located at the bottom of the screen, with text \\'Playlists\\' at approximately [960, 700]. This action is predicted to switch the view to the Playlists section of the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlists\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Browse\\' tab to the \\'Playlists\\' tab. The \\'Playlists\\' tab is now active, but it displays a message \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\' and a button \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'. There is no immediately visible button or option to create a new playlist. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by navigating to the correct section, but further steps are needed to find the playlist creation option.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 796, 35, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 222], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 156, 96, 251], \\'text\\': \\'VLC\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [522, 67, 565, 935], \\'text\\': \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [608, 164, 624, 839], \\'text\\': \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 59, 966, 143], \\'text\\': \\'Video\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 259, 966, 345], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 448, 966, 556], \\'text\\': \\'Browse\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 638, 967, 763], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 863, 967, 940], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [596, 114, 639, 886]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 811, 985, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 604, 987, 804]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 212, 990, 388]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 400, 990, 595]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 6, 992, 196]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [52, 847, 67, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 250, 37, 295]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 812, 98, 876]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 893, 98, 981]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 37, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 143, 37, 186]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 130, 103, 255]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 695, 98, 758]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 788, 38, 950]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

This action is predicted to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the VLC app can then be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the VLC app. Since VLC is not immediately visible, the next step involves scrolling through the app drawer.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This should reveal more apps, hopefully including VLC. The current screen shows a list of apps, and VLC is not visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer down, revealing more applications. The \\'VLC\\' application icon is now visible on the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the VLC app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[781,844],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLC\\' app icon, which is an orange traffic cone located in the bottom right quadrant of the screen, at approximately [781, 844]. This action is predicted to open the VLC application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the VLC app icon was successful. The VLC application launched and is now displayed on the screen, showing its \\'Browse\\' tab. This completes the first subgoal of opening the VLC app.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[960,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab located at the bottom of the screen, with text \\'Playlists\\' at approximately [960, 700]. This action is predicted to switch the view to the Playlists section of the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlists\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Browse\\' tab to the \\'Playlists\\' tab. The \\'Playlists\\' tab is now active, but it displays a message \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\' and a button \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'. There is no immediately visible button or option to create a new playlist. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by navigating to the correct section, but further steps are needed to find the playlist creation option.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,937],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located in the top right corner of the screen, at approximately [83, 937]. This is predicted to open a context menu which might contain an option to create a new playlist. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The VLC application is open, and its main interface is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This menu appeared in the top right area of the screen as a result of tapping the three-dot icon (indicated by the red ring in the first image). The rest of the screen, including the \"No media files found...\" message and the bottom navigation bar, remains unchanged.', 'StepByStepExplanation': \"The last action was to tap the three-dot menu icon in the top right corner of the 'Playlists' screen, hoping to find an option to create a new playlist. The action successfully opened a menu, but the menu only contained 'Display in list' and 'Refresh' options, neither of which is for creating a new playlist. Therefore, this approach did not lead to the desired outcome. The active subgoal 'Navigate to Playlists and initiate new playlist creation' is still in progress.

This action is predicted to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the VLC app can then be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the VLC app. Since VLC is not immediately visible, the next step involves scrolling through the app drawer.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This should reveal more apps, hopefully including VLC. The current screen shows a list of apps, and VLC is not visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer down, revealing more applications. The \\'VLC\\' application icon is now visible on the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the VLC app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[781,844],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLC\\' app icon, which is an orange traffic cone located in the bottom right quadrant of the screen, at approximately [781, 844]. This action is predicted to open the VLC application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the VLC app icon was successful. The VLC application launched and is now displayed on the screen, showing its \\'Browse\\' tab. This completes the first subgoal of opening the VLC app.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[960,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab located at the bottom of the screen, with text \\'Playlists\\' at approximately [960, 700]. This action is predicted to switch the view to the Playlists section of the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlists\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Browse\\' tab to the \\'Playlists\\' tab. The \\'Playlists\\' tab is now active, but it displays a message \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\' and a button \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'. There is no immediately visible button or option to create a new playlist. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by navigating to the correct section, but further steps are needed to find the playlist creation option.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,937],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located in the top right corner of the screen, at approximately [83, 937]. This is predicted to open a context menu which might contain an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [83, 937] was successful in opening a context menu. The menu appeared near the tapped location and contains two options: \"Display in list\" and \"Refresh\". Neither of these options allows for creating a new playlist. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not bring the agent closer to initiating playlist creation.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 796, 34, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 222], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 156, 96, 251], \\'text\\': \\'VLC\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [83, 547, 108, 791], \\'text\\': \\'Display in list\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [137, 551, 154, 691], \\'text\\': \\'Refresh\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [522, 67, 565, 935], \\'text\\': \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [608, 164, 624, 839], \\'text\\': \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 59, 966, 143], \\'text\\': \\'Video\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 259, 966, 345], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 448, 966, 556], \\'text\\': \\'Browse\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 638, 967, 763], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 863, 967, 940], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 811, 985, 983]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 603, 987, 805]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [596, 114, 639, 887]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 212, 991, 388]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 400, 989, 594]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 246, 37, 297]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 6, 992, 197]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 193, 37, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 137, 36, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 511, 121, 987]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the list of all installed applications, where the VLC app can then be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer. The screen now displays a list of installed applications. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the VLC app. Since VLC is not immediately visible, the next step involves scrolling through the app drawer.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This should reveal more apps, hopefully including VLC. The current screen shows a list of apps, and VLC is not visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer down, revealing more applications. The \\'VLC\\' application icon is now visible on the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the VLC app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[781,844],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLC\\' app icon, which is an orange traffic cone located in the bottom right quadrant of the screen, at approximately [781, 844]. This action is predicted to open the VLC application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the VLC app icon was successful. The VLC application launched and is now displayed on the screen, showing its \\'Browse\\' tab. This completes the first subgoal of opening the VLC app.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[960,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab located at the bottom of the screen, with text \\'Playlists\\' at approximately [960, 700]. This action is predicted to switch the view to the Playlists section of the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlists\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Browse\\' tab to the \\'Playlists\\' tab. The \\'Playlists\\' tab is now active, but it displays a message \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\' and a button \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'. There is no immediately visible button or option to create a new playlist. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by navigating to the correct section, but further steps are needed to find the playlist creation option.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,937],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located in the top right corner of the screen, at approximately [83, 937]. This is predicted to open a context menu which might contain an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [83, 937] was successful in opening a context menu. The menu appeared near the tapped location and contains two options: \"Display in list\" and \"Refresh\". Neither of these options allows for creating a new playlist. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not bring the agent closer to initiating playlist creation.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,203],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLC\\' text at [85, 203] to dismiss the pop-up menu. The pop-up menu is currently visible with options \\'Display in list\\' and \\'Refresh\\'. This action is predicted to close the pop-up menu, returning the screen to its state before the menu was opened, allowing interaction with other elements like the bottom navigation bar. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The VLC application is open, and its main interface is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This should reveal more apps, hopefully including VLC. The current screen shows a list of apps, and VLC is not visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer down, revealing more applications. The \\'VLC\\' application icon is now visible on the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the VLC app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[781,844],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLC\\' app icon, which is an orange traffic cone located in the bottom right quadrant of the screen, at approximately [781, 844]. This action is predicted to open the VLC application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the VLC app icon was successful. The VLC application launched and is now displayed on the screen, showing its \\'Browse\\' tab. This completes the first subgoal of opening the VLC app.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[960,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab located at the bottom of the screen, with text \\'Playlists\\' at approximately [960, 700]. This action is predicted to switch the view to the Playlists section of the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlists\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Browse\\' tab to the \\'Playlists\\' tab. The \\'Playlists\\' tab is now active, but it displays a message \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\' and a button \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'. There is no immediately visible button or option to create a new playlist. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by navigating to the correct section, but further steps are needed to find the playlist creation option.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,937],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located in the top right corner of the screen, at approximately [83, 937]. This is predicted to open a context menu which might contain an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [83, 937] was successful in opening a context menu. The menu appeared near the tapped location and contains two options: \"Display in list\" and \"Refresh\". Neither of these options allows for creating a new playlist. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not bring the agent closer to initiating playlist creation.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,203],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLC\\' text at [85, 203] to dismiss the pop-up menu. The pop-up menu is currently visible with options \\'Display in list\\' and \\'Refresh\\'. This action is predicted to close the pop-up menu, returning the screen to its state before the menu was opened, allowing interaction with other elements like the bottom navigation bar. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLC\\' text at [85, 203] successfully dismissed the pop-up menu. The screen returned to the Playlists view without the overlay. This action was successful in clearing the screen to allow further interaction, but it did not directly progress towards creating a playlist. However, it enables the next planned step.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 796, 34, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 156, 96, 251], \\'text\\': \\'VLC\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [522, 67, 565, 935], \\'text\\': \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [608, 164, 624, 839], \\'text\\': \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 59, 966, 143], \\'text\\': \\'Video\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 259, 966, 345], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 448, 966, 556], \\'text\\': \\'Browse\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 638, 967, 763], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 863, 967, 940], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [596, 114, 639, 886]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 811, 985, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 604, 987, 804]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 212, 990, 388]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 400, 990, 595]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 6, 992, 196]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [52, 847, 67, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 250, 37, 295]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 812, 98, 876]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 143, 37, 186]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 37, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 893, 98, 980]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 696, 98, 758]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 789, 38, 950]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This should reveal more apps, hopefully including VLC. The current screen shows a list of apps, and VLC is not visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer down, revealing more applications. The \\'VLC\\' application icon is now visible on the screen. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the VLC app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[781,844],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLC\\' app icon, which is an orange traffic cone located in the bottom right quadrant of the screen, at approximately [781, 844]. This action is predicted to open the VLC application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the VLC app icon was successful. The VLC application launched and is now displayed on the screen, showing its \\'Browse\\' tab. This completes the first subgoal of opening the VLC app.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[960,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab located at the bottom of the screen, with text \\'Playlists\\' at approximately [960, 700]. This action is predicted to switch the view to the Playlists section of the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlists\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Browse\\' tab to the \\'Playlists\\' tab. The \\'Playlists\\' tab is now active, but it displays a message \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\' and a button \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'. There is no immediately visible button or option to create a new playlist. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by navigating to the correct section, but further steps are needed to find the playlist creation option.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,937],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located in the top right corner of the screen, at approximately [83, 937]. This is predicted to open a context menu which might contain an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [83, 937] was successful in opening a context menu. The menu appeared near the tapped location and contains two options: \"Display in list\" and \"Refresh\". Neither of these options allows for creating a new playlist. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not bring the agent closer to initiating playlist creation.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,203],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLC\\' text at [85, 203] to dismiss the pop-up menu. The pop-up menu is currently visible with options \\'Display in list\\' and \\'Refresh\\'. This action is predicted to close the pop-up menu, returning the screen to its state before the menu was opened, allowing interaction with other elements like the bottom navigation bar. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLC\\' text at [85, 203] successfully dismissed the pop-up menu. The screen returned to the Playlists view without the overlay. This action was successful in clearing the screen to allow further interaction, but it did not directly progress towards creating a playlist. However, it enables the next planned step.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' option in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'More\\' text is detected at [951, 863, 967, 940] and its icon bounding box is [913, 811, 985, 982]. Tapping the center of the icon at approximately [959, 901]. This is predicted to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be found. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The VLC application is open, and its main interface is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[781,844],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLC\\' app icon, which is an orange traffic cone located in the bottom right quadrant of the screen, at approximately [781, 844]. This action is predicted to open the VLC application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the VLC app icon was successful. The VLC application launched and is now displayed on the screen, showing its \\'Browse\\' tab. This completes the first subgoal of opening the VLC app.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[960,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab located at the bottom of the screen, with text \\'Playlists\\' at approximately [960, 700]. This action is predicted to switch the view to the Playlists section of the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlists\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Browse\\' tab to the \\'Playlists\\' tab. The \\'Playlists\\' tab is now active, but it displays a message \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\' and a button \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'. There is no immediately visible button or option to create a new playlist. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by navigating to the correct section, but further steps are needed to find the playlist creation option.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,937],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located in the top right corner of the screen, at approximately [83, 937]. This is predicted to open a context menu which might contain an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [83, 937] was successful in opening a context menu. The menu appeared near the tapped location and contains two options: \"Display in list\" and \"Refresh\". Neither of these options allows for creating a new playlist. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not bring the agent closer to initiating playlist creation.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,203],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLC\\' text at [85, 203] to dismiss the pop-up menu. The pop-up menu is currently visible with options \\'Display in list\\' and \\'Refresh\\'. This action is predicted to close the pop-up menu, returning the screen to its state before the menu was opened, allowing interaction with other elements like the bottom navigation bar. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLC\\' text at [85, 203] successfully dismissed the pop-up menu. The screen returned to the Playlists view without the overlay. This action was successful in clearing the screen to allow further interaction, but it did not directly progress towards creating a playlist. However, it enables the next planned step.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' option in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'More\\' text is detected at [951, 863, 967, 940] and its icon bounding box is [913, 811, 985, 982]. Tapping the center of the icon at approximately [959, 901]. This is predicted to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'More\\' option in the bottom navigation bar was successful. The app navigated to the \\'More\\' screen. This screen contains \\'SETTINGS\\', \\'ABOUT\\', and \\'Streams\\' sections, with a \\'New stream\\' button. No option to create a new playlist from local files was found in this section. While the action itself was executed correctly, it did not bring the agent closer to initiating playlist creation. The next step will be to navigate back to the \\'Playlists\\' tab to try a different approach.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 796, 35, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 222], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 156, 96, 251], \\'text\\': \\'VLC\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [159, 196, 176, 386], \\'text\\': \\'SETTINGS\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [160, 709, 175, 836], \\'text\\': \\'ABOUT\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [233, 34, 252, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Streams\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [360, 127, 377, 339], \\'text\\': \\'New stream\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 59, 966, 143], \\'text\\': \\'Video\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 259, 966, 345], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 448, 966, 556], \\'text\\': \\'Browse\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 638, 967, 763], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 863, 966, 939], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [272, 33, 396, 429]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 513, 189, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 33, 189, 485]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 219, 991, 382]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 607, 989, 800]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 818, 986, 978]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 247, 38, 296]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 38, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [911, 403, 993, 592]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 6, 996, 194]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 133, 37, 186]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 134, 104, 258]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 789, 40, 950]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 909, 97, 983]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [153, 62, 183, 126]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[781,844],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLC\\' app icon, which is an orange traffic cone located in the bottom right quadrant of the screen, at approximately [781, 844]. This action is predicted to open the VLC application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the VLC app icon was successful. The VLC application launched and is now displayed on the screen, showing its \\'Browse\\' tab. This completes the first subgoal of opening the VLC app.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[960,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab located at the bottom of the screen, with text \\'Playlists\\' at approximately [960, 700]. This action is predicted to switch the view to the Playlists section of the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlists\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Browse\\' tab to the \\'Playlists\\' tab. The \\'Playlists\\' tab is now active, but it displays a message \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\' and a button \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'. There is no immediately visible button or option to create a new playlist. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by navigating to the correct section, but further steps are needed to find the playlist creation option.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,937],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located in the top right corner of the screen, at approximately [83, 937]. This is predicted to open a context menu which might contain an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [83, 937] was successful in opening a context menu. The menu appeared near the tapped location and contains two options: \"Display in list\" and \"Refresh\". Neither of these options allows for creating a new playlist. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not bring the agent closer to initiating playlist creation.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,203],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLC\\' text at [85, 203] to dismiss the pop-up menu. The pop-up menu is currently visible with options \\'Display in list\\' and \\'Refresh\\'. This action is predicted to close the pop-up menu, returning the screen to its state before the menu was opened, allowing interaction with other elements like the bottom navigation bar. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLC\\' text at [85, 203] successfully dismissed the pop-up menu. The screen returned to the Playlists view without the overlay. This action was successful in clearing the screen to allow further interaction, but it did not directly progress towards creating a playlist. However, it enables the next planned step.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' option in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'More\\' text is detected at [951, 863, 967, 940] and its icon bounding box is [913, 811, 985, 982]. Tapping the center of the icon at approximately [959, 901]. This is predicted to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'More\\' option in the bottom navigation bar was successful. The app navigated to the \\'More\\' screen. This screen contains \\'SETTINGS\\', \\'ABOUT\\', and \\'Streams\\' sections, with a \\'New stream\\' button. No option to create a new playlist from local files was found in this section. While the action itself was executed correctly, it did not bring the agent closer to initiating playlist creation. The next step will be to navigate back to the \\'Playlists\\' tab to try a different approach.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[951,703],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Playlists\\' text is detected at [952, 638, 967, 763]. The center of the tab is approximately [951, 703]. This action is predicted to switch the view from the \\'More\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The VLC application is open, and its main interface is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[960,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab located at the bottom of the screen, with text \\'Playlists\\' at approximately [960, 700]. This action is predicted to switch the view to the Playlists section of the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlists\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Browse\\' tab to the \\'Playlists\\' tab. The \\'Playlists\\' tab is now active, but it displays a message \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\' and a button \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'. There is no immediately visible button or option to create a new playlist. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by navigating to the correct section, but further steps are needed to find the playlist creation option.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,937],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located in the top right corner of the screen, at approximately [83, 937]. This is predicted to open a context menu which might contain an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [83, 937] was successful in opening a context menu. The menu appeared near the tapped location and contains two options: \"Display in list\" and \"Refresh\". Neither of these options allows for creating a new playlist. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not bring the agent closer to initiating playlist creation.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,203],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLC\\' text at [85, 203] to dismiss the pop-up menu. The pop-up menu is currently visible with options \\'Display in list\\' and \\'Refresh\\'. This action is predicted to close the pop-up menu, returning the screen to its state before the menu was opened, allowing interaction with other elements like the bottom navigation bar. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLC\\' text at [85, 203] successfully dismissed the pop-up menu. The screen returned to the Playlists view without the overlay. This action was successful in clearing the screen to allow further interaction, but it did not directly progress towards creating a playlist. However, it enables the next planned step.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' option in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'More\\' text is detected at [951, 863, 967, 940] and its icon bounding box is [913, 811, 985, 982]. Tapping the center of the icon at approximately [959, 901]. This is predicted to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'More\\' option in the bottom navigation bar was successful. The app navigated to the \\'More\\' screen. This screen contains \\'SETTINGS\\', \\'ABOUT\\', and \\'Streams\\' sections, with a \\'New stream\\' button. No option to create a new playlist from local files was found in this section. While the action itself was executed correctly, it did not bring the agent closer to initiating playlist creation. The next step will be to navigate back to the \\'Playlists\\' tab to try a different approach.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[951,703],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Playlists\\' text is detected at [952, 638, 967, 763]. The center of the tab is approximately [951, 703]. This action is predicted to switch the view from the \\'More\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlists\\' tab at [951, 703] was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'More\\' screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Playlists\\' screen is now active and displays the message \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\' along with a button \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'. This action brought the agent back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, which is a necessary step to explore further options for playlist creation and aligns with the plan.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 796, 35, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 222], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 156, 96, 251], \\'text\\': \\'VLC\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [522, 67, 565, 935], \\'text\\': \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [608, 164, 624, 839], \\'text\\': \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 59, 966, 143], \\'text\\': \\'Video\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 259, 966, 345], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 448, 966, 556], \\'text\\': \\'Browse\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [949, 636, 968, 764], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 863, 967, 940], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [596, 114, 639, 886]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 811, 984, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 603, 987, 804]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 212, 990, 388]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 401, 990, 593]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 6, 991, 196]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [52, 847, 67, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 250, 37, 295]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 812, 98, 876]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 142, 37, 186]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 893, 98, 981]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 37, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 130, 103, 255]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 696, 98, 758]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 788, 38, 949]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[960,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab located at the bottom of the screen, with text \\'Playlists\\' at approximately [960, 700]. This action is predicted to switch the view to the Playlists section of the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlists\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Browse\\' tab to the \\'Playlists\\' tab. The \\'Playlists\\' tab is now active, but it displays a message \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\' and a button \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'. There is no immediately visible button or option to create a new playlist. This action brought the agent closer to completing the subgoal by navigating to the correct section, but further steps are needed to find the playlist creation option.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,937],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located in the top right corner of the screen, at approximately [83, 937]. This is predicted to open a context menu which might contain an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [83, 937] was successful in opening a context menu. The menu appeared near the tapped location and contains two options: \"Display in list\" and \"Refresh\". Neither of these options allows for creating a new playlist. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not bring the agent closer to initiating playlist creation.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,203],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLC\\' text at [85, 203] to dismiss the pop-up menu. The pop-up menu is currently visible with options \\'Display in list\\' and \\'Refresh\\'. This action is predicted to close the pop-up menu, returning the screen to its state before the menu was opened, allowing interaction with other elements like the bottom navigation bar. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLC\\' text at [85, 203] successfully dismissed the pop-up menu. The screen returned to the Playlists view without the overlay. This action was successful in clearing the screen to allow further interaction, but it did not directly progress towards creating a playlist. However, it enables the next planned step.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' option in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'More\\' text is detected at [951, 863, 967, 940] and its icon bounding box is [913, 811, 985, 982]. Tapping the center of the icon at approximately [959, 901]. This is predicted to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'More\\' option in the bottom navigation bar was successful. The app navigated to the \\'More\\' screen. This screen contains \\'SETTINGS\\', \\'ABOUT\\', and \\'Streams\\' sections, with a \\'New stream\\' button. No option to create a new playlist from local files was found in this section. While the action itself was executed correctly, it did not bring the agent closer to initiating playlist creation. The next step will be to navigate back to the \\'Playlists\\' tab to try a different approach.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[951,703],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Playlists\\' text is detected at [952, 638, 967, 763]. The center of the tab is approximately [951, 703]. This action is predicted to switch the view from the \\'More\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlists\\' tab at [951, 703] was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'More\\' screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Playlists\\' screen is now active and displays the message \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\' along with a button \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'. This action brought the agent back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, which is a necessary step to explore further options for playlist creation and aligns with the plan.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[616,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\' button. The button text is detected at [608, 164, 624, 839]. Tapping the center of this button at approximately [616, 501]. This is predicted to navigate to the Medialibrary Preferences screen, where an option to create a new playlist might be found. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The VLC application is open, and its main interface is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,937],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located in the top right corner of the screen, at approximately [83, 937]. This is predicted to open a context menu which might contain an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [83, 937] was successful in opening a context menu. The menu appeared near the tapped location and contains two options: \"Display in list\" and \"Refresh\". Neither of these options allows for creating a new playlist. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not bring the agent closer to initiating playlist creation.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,203],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLC\\' text at [85, 203] to dismiss the pop-up menu. The pop-up menu is currently visible with options \\'Display in list\\' and \\'Refresh\\'. This action is predicted to close the pop-up menu, returning the screen to its state before the menu was opened, allowing interaction with other elements like the bottom navigation bar. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLC\\' text at [85, 203] successfully dismissed the pop-up menu. The screen returned to the Playlists view without the overlay. This action was successful in clearing the screen to allow further interaction, but it did not directly progress towards creating a playlist. However, it enables the next planned step.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' option in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'More\\' text is detected at [951, 863, 967, 940] and its icon bounding box is [913, 811, 985, 982]. Tapping the center of the icon at approximately [959, 901]. This is predicted to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'More\\' option in the bottom navigation bar was successful. The app navigated to the \\'More\\' screen. This screen contains \\'SETTINGS\\', \\'ABOUT\\', and \\'Streams\\' sections, with a \\'New stream\\' button. No option to create a new playlist from local files was found in this section. While the action itself was executed correctly, it did not bring the agent closer to initiating playlist creation. The next step will be to navigate back to the \\'Playlists\\' tab to try a different approach.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[951,703],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Playlists\\' text is detected at [952, 638, 967, 763]. The center of the tab is approximately [951, 703]. This action is predicted to switch the view from the \\'More\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlists\\' tab at [951, 703] was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'More\\' screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Playlists\\' screen is now active and displays the message \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\' along with a button \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'. This action brought the agent back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, which is a necessary step to explore further options for playlist creation and aligns with the plan.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[616,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\' button. The button text is detected at [608, 164, 624, 839]. Tapping the center of this button at approximately [616, 501]. This is predicted to navigate to the Medialibrary Preferences screen, where an option to create a new playlist might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\' button was successful. The app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen. This new screen allows the user to specify which storage locations VLC should scan for media files. This is a necessary step as the app previously reported no media files found, and configuring media sources might be a prerequisite for creating playlists.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 796, 35, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 66, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 172, 97, 830], \\'text\\': \\'Select directories to include..\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [154, 33, 177, 218], \\'text\\': \\'Storages\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [200, 140, 239, 435], \\'text\\': \\'Internal memory 15 subfolders\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [255, 143, 292, 338], \\'text\\': \\'0000-0000 No subfolder\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [307, 143, 344, 338], \\'text\\': \\'0000-0000 14 subfolders\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [390, 36, 410, 325], \\'text\\': \\'Local Network\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [492, 245, 511, 792], \\'text\\': \\'No connection to local network.\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 249, 37, 296]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 142, 37, 186]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [302, 2, 350, 101]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 194, 37, 238]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [197, 2, 246, 98]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [248, 1, 298, 102]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 915, 99, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 137, 101, 853]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [10, 778, 43, 955]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,937],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located in the top right corner of the screen, at approximately [83, 937]. This is predicted to open a context menu which might contain an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [83, 937] was successful in opening a context menu. The menu appeared near the tapped location and contains two options: \"Display in list\" and \"Refresh\". Neither of these options allows for creating a new playlist. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not bring the agent closer to initiating playlist creation.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,203],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLC\\' text at [85, 203] to dismiss the pop-up menu. The pop-up menu is currently visible with options \\'Display in list\\' and \\'Refresh\\'. This action is predicted to close the pop-up menu, returning the screen to its state before the menu was opened, allowing interaction with other elements like the bottom navigation bar. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLC\\' text at [85, 203] successfully dismissed the pop-up menu. The screen returned to the Playlists view without the overlay. This action was successful in clearing the screen to allow further interaction, but it did not directly progress towards creating a playlist. However, it enables the next planned step.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' option in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'More\\' text is detected at [951, 863, 967, 940] and its icon bounding box is [913, 811, 985, 982]. Tapping the center of the icon at approximately [959, 901]. This is predicted to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'More\\' option in the bottom navigation bar was successful. The app navigated to the \\'More\\' screen. This screen contains \\'SETTINGS\\', \\'ABOUT\\', and \\'Streams\\' sections, with a \\'New stream\\' button. No option to create a new playlist from local files was found in this section. While the action itself was executed correctly, it did not bring the agent closer to initiating playlist creation. The next step will be to navigate back to the \\'Playlists\\' tab to try a different approach.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[951,703],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Playlists\\' text is detected at [952, 638, 967, 763]. The center of the tab is approximately [951, 703]. This action is predicted to switch the view from the \\'More\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlists\\' tab at [951, 703] was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'More\\' screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Playlists\\' screen is now active and displays the message \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\' along with a button \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'. This action brought the agent back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, which is a necessary step to explore further options for playlist creation and aligns with the plan.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[616,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\' button. The button text is detected at [608, 164, 624, 839]. Tapping the center of this button at approximately [616, 501]. This is predicted to navigate to the Medialibrary Preferences screen, where an option to create a new playlist might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\' button was successful. The app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen. This new screen allows the user to specify which storage locations VLC should scan for media files. This is a necessary step as the app previously reported no media files found, and configuring media sources might be a prerequisite for creating playlists.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[221,50],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkbox next to \\'Internal memory\\'. The checkbox is located at approximately [221, 50], associated with the text \\'Internal memory\\' [200, 140, 239, 435]. This action is predicted to select \\'Internal memory\\' as a source for media files, which may trigger a media scan or enable further actions related to media management and playlist creation. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The VLC application is open, and its main interface is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,203],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLC\\' text at [85, 203] to dismiss the pop-up menu. The pop-up menu is currently visible with options \\'Display in list\\' and \\'Refresh\\'. This action is predicted to close the pop-up menu, returning the screen to its state before the menu was opened, allowing interaction with other elements like the bottom navigation bar. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLC\\' text at [85, 203] successfully dismissed the pop-up menu. The screen returned to the Playlists view without the overlay. This action was successful in clearing the screen to allow further interaction, but it did not directly progress towards creating a playlist. However, it enables the next planned step.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' option in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'More\\' text is detected at [951, 863, 967, 940] and its icon bounding box is [913, 811, 985, 982]. Tapping the center of the icon at approximately [959, 901]. This is predicted to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'More\\' option in the bottom navigation bar was successful. The app navigated to the \\'More\\' screen. This screen contains \\'SETTINGS\\', \\'ABOUT\\', and \\'Streams\\' sections, with a \\'New stream\\' button. No option to create a new playlist from local files was found in this section. While the action itself was executed correctly, it did not bring the agent closer to initiating playlist creation. The next step will be to navigate back to the \\'Playlists\\' tab to try a different approach.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[951,703],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Playlists\\' text is detected at [952, 638, 967, 763]. The center of the tab is approximately [951, 703]. This action is predicted to switch the view from the \\'More\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlists\\' tab at [951, 703] was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'More\\' screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Playlists\\' screen is now active and displays the message \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\' along with a button \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'. This action brought the agent back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, which is a necessary step to explore further options for playlist creation and aligns with the plan.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[616,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\' button. The button text is detected at [608, 164, 624, 839]. Tapping the center of this button at approximately [616, 501]. This is predicted to navigate to the Medialibrary Preferences screen, where an option to create a new playlist might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\' button was successful. The app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen. This new screen allows the user to specify which storage locations VLC should scan for media files. This is a necessary step as the app previously reported no media files found, and configuring media sources might be a prerequisite for creating playlists.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[221,50],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkbox next to \\'Internal memory\\'. The checkbox is located at approximately [221, 50], associated with the text \\'Internal memory\\' [200, 140, 239, 435]. This action is predicted to select \\'Internal memory\\' as a source for media files, which may trigger a media scan or enable further actions related to media management and playlist creation. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkbox next to \\'Internal memory\\' at [221, 50] was successful. The checkbox is now checked, indicating that \\'Internal memory\\' has been selected as a source for media files. No media scan was visibly initiated, nor did any confirmation or save buttons appear on the screen. The application remains on the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen. This step is a prerequisite for VLC to find media files, which in turn is necessary for creating playlists with those files.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.40\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 796, 35, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 66, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 172, 97, 830], \\'text\\': \\'Select directories to include..\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [154, 33, 177, 218], \\'text\\': \\'Storages\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [200, 140, 239, 435], \\'text\\': \\'Internal memory 15 subfolders\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [255, 143, 292, 338], \\'text\\': \\'0000-0000 No subfolder\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [307, 143, 344, 338], \\'text\\': \\'0000-0000 14 subfolders\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [390, 36, 410, 325], \\'text\\': \\'Local Network\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [492, 245, 511, 792], \\'text\\': \\'No connection to local network.\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 249, 37, 296]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [302, 2, 350, 101]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 195, 37, 238]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 143, 37, 186]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [249, 1, 298, 101]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 914, 99, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 138, 101, 853]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [9, 778, 43, 955]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,203],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLC\\' text at [85, 203] to dismiss the pop-up menu. The pop-up menu is currently visible with options \\'Display in list\\' and \\'Refresh\\'. This action is predicted to close the pop-up menu, returning the screen to its state before the menu was opened, allowing interaction with other elements like the bottom navigation bar. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLC\\' text at [85, 203] successfully dismissed the pop-up menu. The screen returned to the Playlists view without the overlay. This action was successful in clearing the screen to allow further interaction, but it did not directly progress towards creating a playlist. However, it enables the next planned step.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' option in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'More\\' text is detected at [951, 863, 967, 940] and its icon bounding box is [913, 811, 985, 982]. Tapping the center of the icon at approximately [959, 901]. This is predicted to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'More\\' option in the bottom navigation bar was successful. The app navigated to the \\'More\\' screen. This screen contains \\'SETTINGS\\', \\'ABOUT\\', and \\'Streams\\' sections, with a \\'New stream\\' button. No option to create a new playlist from local files was found in this section. While the action itself was executed correctly, it did not bring the agent closer to initiating playlist creation. The next step will be to navigate back to the \\'Playlists\\' tab to try a different approach.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[951,703],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Playlists\\' text is detected at [952, 638, 967, 763]. The center of the tab is approximately [951, 703]. This action is predicted to switch the view from the \\'More\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlists\\' tab at [951, 703] was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'More\\' screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Playlists\\' screen is now active and displays the message \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\' along with a button \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'. This action brought the agent back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, which is a necessary step to explore further options for playlist creation and aligns with the plan.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[616,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\' button. The button text is detected at [608, 164, 624, 839]. Tapping the center of this button at approximately [616, 501]. This is predicted to navigate to the Medialibrary Preferences screen, where an option to create a new playlist might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\' button was successful. The app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen. This new screen allows the user to specify which storage locations VLC should scan for media files. This is a necessary step as the app previously reported no media files found, and configuring media sources might be a prerequisite for creating playlists.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[221,50],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkbox next to \\'Internal memory\\'. The checkbox is located at approximately [221, 50], associated with the text \\'Internal memory\\' [200, 140, 239, 435]. This action is predicted to select \\'Internal memory\\' as a source for media files, which may trigger a media scan or enable further actions related to media management and playlist creation. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkbox next to \\'Internal memory\\' at [221, 50] was successful. The checkbox is now checked, indicating that \\'Internal memory\\' has been selected as a source for media files. No media scan was visibly initiated, nor did any confirmation or save buttons appear on the screen. The application remains on the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen. This step is a prerequisite for VLC to find media files, which in turn is necessary for creating playlists with those files.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,55],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located in the top left corner, approximately at [83, 55]. This action is predicted to navigate back from the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen to the previous screen, which is expected to be the \\'Playlists\\' tab. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The VLC application is open, and its main interface is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' option in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'More\\' text is detected at [951, 863, 967, 940] and its icon bounding box is [913, 811, 985, 982]. Tapping the center of the icon at approximately [959, 901]. This is predicted to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'More\\' option in the bottom navigation bar was successful. The app navigated to the \\'More\\' screen. This screen contains \\'SETTINGS\\', \\'ABOUT\\', and \\'Streams\\' sections, with a \\'New stream\\' button. No option to create a new playlist from local files was found in this section. While the action itself was executed correctly, it did not bring the agent closer to initiating playlist creation. The next step will be to navigate back to the \\'Playlists\\' tab to try a different approach.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[951,703],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Playlists\\' text is detected at [952, 638, 967, 763]. The center of the tab is approximately [951, 703]. This action is predicted to switch the view from the \\'More\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlists\\' tab at [951, 703] was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'More\\' screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Playlists\\' screen is now active and displays the message \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\' along with a button \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'. This action brought the agent back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, which is a necessary step to explore further options for playlist creation and aligns with the plan.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[616,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\' button. The button text is detected at [608, 164, 624, 839]. Tapping the center of this button at approximately [616, 501]. This is predicted to navigate to the Medialibrary Preferences screen, where an option to create a new playlist might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\' button was successful. The app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen. This new screen allows the user to specify which storage locations VLC should scan for media files. This is a necessary step as the app previously reported no media files found, and configuring media sources might be a prerequisite for creating playlists.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[221,50],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkbox next to \\'Internal memory\\'. The checkbox is located at approximately [221, 50], associated with the text \\'Internal memory\\' [200, 140, 239, 435]. This action is predicted to select \\'Internal memory\\' as a source for media files, which may trigger a media scan or enable further actions related to media management and playlist creation. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkbox next to \\'Internal memory\\' at [221, 50] was successful. The checkbox is now checked, indicating that \\'Internal memory\\' has been selected as a source for media files. No media scan was visibly initiated, nor did any confirmation or save buttons appear on the screen. The application remains on the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen. This step is a prerequisite for VLC to find media files, which in turn is necessary for creating playlists with those files.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,55],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located in the top left corner, approximately at [83, 55]. This action is predicted to navigate back from the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen to the previous screen, which is expected to be the \\'Playlists\\' tab. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow at [83, 55] was successful. The app navigated from the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' tab. The \\'Playlists\\' tab still displays \\'No media files found...\\'. This action brought the agent back to a previous screen, but it did not directly enable playlist creation. The next step is to try a different approach by using the \\'Browse\\' tab.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 35, 132], \\'text\\': \\'15.41\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 796, 34, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 222], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 156, 96, 251], \\'text\\': \\'VLC\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [522, 67, 565, 935], \\'text\\': \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [608, 164, 624, 839], \\'text\\': \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 59, 966, 143], \\'text\\': \\'Video\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 259, 966, 345], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 448, 966, 556], \\'text\\': \\'Browse\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 638, 967, 763], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 863, 967, 940], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [596, 114, 639, 886]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 811, 985, 982]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 604, 987, 804]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 212, 990, 388]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 400, 990, 595]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 6, 992, 196]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [52, 847, 67, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 250, 37, 295]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 812, 98, 876]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 142, 37, 186]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 893, 98, 981]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 37, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 696, 98, 758]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 130, 103, 255]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 789, 38, 950]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' option in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'More\\' text is detected at [951, 863, 967, 940] and its icon bounding box is [913, 811, 985, 982]. Tapping the center of the icon at approximately [959, 901]. This is predicted to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'More\\' option in the bottom navigation bar was successful. The app navigated to the \\'More\\' screen. This screen contains \\'SETTINGS\\', \\'ABOUT\\', and \\'Streams\\' sections, with a \\'New stream\\' button. No option to create a new playlist from local files was found in this section. While the action itself was executed correctly, it did not bring the agent closer to initiating playlist creation. The next step will be to navigate back to the \\'Playlists\\' tab to try a different approach.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[951,703],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Playlists\\' text is detected at [952, 638, 967, 763]. The center of the tab is approximately [951, 703]. This action is predicted to switch the view from the \\'More\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlists\\' tab at [951, 703] was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'More\\' screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Playlists\\' screen is now active and displays the message \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\' along with a button \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'. This action brought the agent back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, which is a necessary step to explore further options for playlist creation and aligns with the plan.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[616,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\' button. The button text is detected at [608, 164, 624, 839]. Tapping the center of this button at approximately [616, 501]. This is predicted to navigate to the Medialibrary Preferences screen, where an option to create a new playlist might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\' button was successful. The app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen. This new screen allows the user to specify which storage locations VLC should scan for media files. This is a necessary step as the app previously reported no media files found, and configuring media sources might be a prerequisite for creating playlists.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[221,50],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkbox next to \\'Internal memory\\'. The checkbox is located at approximately [221, 50], associated with the text \\'Internal memory\\' [200, 140, 239, 435]. This action is predicted to select \\'Internal memory\\' as a source for media files, which may trigger a media scan or enable further actions related to media management and playlist creation. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkbox next to \\'Internal memory\\' at [221, 50] was successful. The checkbox is now checked, indicating that \\'Internal memory\\' has been selected as a source for media files. No media scan was visibly initiated, nor did any confirmation or save buttons appear on the screen. The application remains on the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen. This step is a prerequisite for VLC to find media files, which in turn is necessary for creating playlists with those files.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,55],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located in the top left corner, approximately at [83, 55]. This action is predicted to navigate back from the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen to the previous screen, which is expected to be the \\'Playlists\\' tab. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow at [83, 55] was successful. The app navigated from the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' tab. The \\'Playlists\\' tab still displays \\'No media files found...\\'. This action brought the agent back to a previous screen, but it did not directly enable playlist creation. The next step is to try a different approach by using the \\'Browse\\' tab.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 11: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[952,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Browse\\' text is detected at [952, 448, 966, 556]. Tapping the center of the \\'Browse\\' tab at approximately [952, 502]. This is predicted to switch the view from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen, where file navigation can occur. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The VLC application is open, and its main interface is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The \\'Playlists\\' text is detected at [952, 638, 967, 763]. The center of the tab is approximately [951, 703]. This action is predicted to switch the view from the \\'More\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlists\\' tab at [951, 703] was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'More\\' screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Playlists\\' screen is now active and displays the message \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\' along with a button \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'. This action brought the agent back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, which is a necessary step to explore further options for playlist creation and aligns with the plan.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[616,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\' button. The button text is detected at [608, 164, 624, 839]. Tapping the center of this button at approximately [616, 501]. This is predicted to navigate to the Medialibrary Preferences screen, where an option to create a new playlist might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\' button was successful. The app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen. This new screen allows the user to specify which storage locations VLC should scan for media files. This is a necessary step as the app previously reported no media files found, and configuring media sources might be a prerequisite for creating playlists.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[221,50],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkbox next to \\'Internal memory\\'. The checkbox is located at approximately [221, 50], associated with the text \\'Internal memory\\' [200, 140, 239, 435]. This action is predicted to select \\'Internal memory\\' as a source for media files, which may trigger a media scan or enable further actions related to media management and playlist creation. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkbox next to \\'Internal memory\\' at [221, 50] was successful. The checkbox is now checked, indicating that \\'Internal memory\\' has been selected as a source for media files. No media scan was visibly initiated, nor did any confirmation or save buttons appear on the screen. The application remains on the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen. This step is a prerequisite for VLC to find media files, which in turn is necessary for creating playlists with those files.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,55],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located in the top left corner, approximately at [83, 55]. This action is predicted to navigate back from the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen to the previous screen, which is expected to be the \\'Playlists\\' tab. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow at [83, 55] was successful. The app navigated from the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' tab. The \\'Playlists\\' tab still displays \\'No media files found...\\'. This action brought the agent back to a previous screen, but it did not directly enable playlist creation. The next step is to try a different approach by using the \\'Browse\\' tab.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[952,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Browse\\' text is detected at [952, 448, 966, 556]. Tapping the center of the \\'Browse\\' tab at approximately [952, 502]. This is predicted to switch the view from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen, where file navigation can occur. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Browse\\' tab at [952, 502] was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. The \\'Browse\\' screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\' and \\'SDCARD\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[951,703],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Playlists\\' text is detected at [952, 638, 967, 763]. The center of the tab is approximately [951, 703]. This action is predicted to switch the view from the \\'More\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlists\\' tab at [951, 703] was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'More\\' screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Playlists\\' screen is now active and displays the message \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\' along with a button \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'. This action brought the agent back to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, which is a necessary step to explore further options for playlist creation and aligns with the plan.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[616,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\' button. The button text is detected at [608, 164, 624, 839]. Tapping the center of this button at approximately [616, 501]. This is predicted to navigate to the Medialibrary Preferences screen, where an option to create a new playlist might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\' button was successful. The app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen. This new screen allows the user to specify which storage locations VLC should scan for media files. This is a necessary step as the app previously reported no media files found, and configuring media sources might be a prerequisite for creating playlists.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[221,50],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkbox next to \\'Internal memory\\'. The checkbox is located at approximately [221, 50], associated with the text \\'Internal memory\\' [200, 140, 239, 435]. This action is predicted to select \\'Internal memory\\' as a source for media files, which may trigger a media scan or enable further actions related to media management and playlist creation. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkbox next to \\'Internal memory\\' at [221, 50] was successful. The checkbox is now checked, indicating that \\'Internal memory\\' has been selected as a source for media files. No media scan was visibly initiated, nor did any confirmation or save buttons appear on the screen. The application remains on the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen. This step is a prerequisite for VLC to find media files, which in turn is necessary for creating playlists with those files.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,55],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located in the top left corner, approximately at [83, 55]. This action is predicted to navigate back from the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen to the previous screen, which is expected to be the \\'Playlists\\' tab. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow at [83, 55] was successful. The app navigated from the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' tab. The \\'Playlists\\' tab still displays \\'No media files found...\\'. This action brought the agent back to a previous screen, but it did not directly enable playlist creation. The next step is to try a different approach by using the \\'Browse\\' tab.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[952,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Browse\\' text is detected at [952, 448, 966, 556]. Tapping the center of the \\'Browse\\' tab at approximately [952, 502]. This is predicted to switch the view from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen, where file navigation can occur. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Browse\\' tab at [952, 502] was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. The \\'Browse\\' screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\' and \\'SDCARD\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to finding the specified video files, which is a prerequisite for creating the playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Internal memory\\' folder icon, which is located under \\'Storages\\'. The text \\'Inte\\' is at [484, 188, 499, 252] and \\'nory\\' at [485, 59, 517, 135]. The center of the folder icon is approximately [459, 184]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Internal memory\\' directory, allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[616,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\' button. The button text is detected at [608, 164, 624, 839]. Tapping the center of this button at approximately [616, 501]. This is predicted to navigate to the Medialibrary Preferences screen, where an option to create a new playlist might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\' button was successful. The app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen. This new screen allows the user to specify which storage locations VLC should scan for media files. This is a necessary step as the app previously reported no media files found, and configuring media sources might be a prerequisite for creating playlists.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[221,50],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkbox next to \\'Internal memory\\'. The checkbox is located at approximately [221, 50], associated with the text \\'Internal memory\\' [200, 140, 239, 435]. This action is predicted to select \\'Internal memory\\' as a source for media files, which may trigger a media scan or enable further actions related to media management and playlist creation. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkbox next to \\'Internal memory\\' at [221, 50] was successful. The checkbox is now checked, indicating that \\'Internal memory\\' has been selected as a source for media files. No media scan was visibly initiated, nor did any confirmation or save buttons appear on the screen. The application remains on the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen. This step is a prerequisite for VLC to find media files, which in turn is necessary for creating playlists with those files.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,55],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located in the top left corner, approximately at [83, 55]. This action is predicted to navigate back from the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen to the previous screen, which is expected to be the \\'Playlists\\' tab. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow at [83, 55] was successful. The app navigated from the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' tab. The \\'Playlists\\' tab still displays \\'No media files found...\\'. This action brought the agent back to a previous screen, but it did not directly enable playlist creation. The next step is to try a different approach by using the \\'Browse\\' tab.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[952,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Browse\\' text is detected at [952, 448, 966, 556]. Tapping the center of the \\'Browse\\' tab at approximately [952, 502]. This is predicted to switch the view from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen, where file navigation can occur. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Browse\\' tab at [952, 502] was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. The \\'Browse\\' screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\' and \\'SDCARD\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to finding the specified video files, which is a prerequisite for creating the playlist.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Internal memory\\' folder icon, which is located under \\'Storages\\'. The text \\'Inte\\' is at [484, 188, 499, 252] and \\'nory\\' at [485, 59, 517, 135]. The center of the folder icon is approximately [459, 184]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Internal memory\\' directory, allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Internal memory\\' was successful. The screen changed to display the contents of the internal storage. This action brought the agent closer to finding the specified video files, which is a prerequisite for creating the playlist. The next step is to locate the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder within the \\'Internal memory\\'.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[616,501],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\' button. The button text is detected at [608, 164, 624, 839]. Tapping the center of this button at approximately [616, 501]. This is predicted to navigate to the Medialibrary Preferences screen, where an option to create a new playlist might be found. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\' button was successful. The app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen. This new screen allows the user to specify which storage locations VLC should scan for media files. This is a necessary step as the app previously reported no media files found, and configuring media sources might be a prerequisite for creating playlists.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[221,50],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkbox next to \\'Internal memory\\'. The checkbox is located at approximately [221, 50], associated with the text \\'Internal memory\\' [200, 140, 239, 435]. This action is predicted to select \\'Internal memory\\' as a source for media files, which may trigger a media scan or enable further actions related to media management and playlist creation. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkbox next to \\'Internal memory\\' at [221, 50] was successful. The checkbox is now checked, indicating that \\'Internal memory\\' has been selected as a source for media files. No media scan was visibly initiated, nor did any confirmation or save buttons appear on the screen. The application remains on the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen. This step is a prerequisite for VLC to find media files, which in turn is necessary for creating playlists with those files.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,55],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located in the top left corner, approximately at [83, 55]. This action is predicted to navigate back from the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen to the previous screen, which is expected to be the \\'Playlists\\' tab. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow at [83, 55] was successful. The app navigated from the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' tab. The \\'Playlists\\' tab still displays \\'No media files found...\\'. This action brought the agent back to a previous screen, but it did not directly enable playlist creation. The next step is to try a different approach by using the \\'Browse\\' tab.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[952,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Browse\\' text is detected at [952, 448, 966, 556]. Tapping the center of the \\'Browse\\' tab at approximately [952, 502]. This is predicted to switch the view from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen, where file navigation can occur. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Browse\\' tab at [952, 502] was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. The \\'Browse\\' screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\' and \\'SDCARD\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to finding the specified video files, which is a prerequisite for creating the playlist.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Internal memory\\' folder icon, which is located under \\'Storages\\'.

This action is predicted to open the \\'Internal memory\\' directory, allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Internal memory\\' was successful. The screen changed to display the contents of the internal storage. This action brought the agent closer to finding the specified video files, which is a prerequisite for creating the playlist. The next step is to locate the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder within the \\'Internal memory\\'.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 13: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[221,50],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkbox next to \\'Internal memory\\'. The checkbox is located at approximately [221, 50], associated with the text \\'Internal memory\\' [200, 140, 239, 435]. This action is predicted to select \\'Internal memory\\' as a source for media files, which may trigger a media scan or enable further actions related to media management and playlist creation. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkbox next to \\'Internal memory\\' at [221, 50] was successful. The checkbox is now checked, indicating that \\'Internal memory\\' has been selected as a source for media files. No media scan was visibly initiated, nor did any confirmation or save buttons appear on the screen. The application remains on the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen. This step is a prerequisite for VLC to find media files, which in turn is necessary for creating playlists with those files.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,55],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located in the top left corner, approximately at [83, 55]. This action is predicted to navigate back from the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen to the previous screen, which is expected to be the \\'Playlists\\' tab. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow at [83, 55] was successful. The app navigated from the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' tab. The \\'Playlists\\' tab still displays \\'No media files found...\\'. This action brought the agent back to a previous screen, but it did not directly enable playlist creation. The next step is to try a different approach by using the \\'Browse\\' tab.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[952,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Browse\\' text is detected at [952, 448, 966, 556]. Tapping the center of the \\'Browse\\' tab at approximately [952, 502]. This is predicted to switch the view from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen, where file navigation can occur. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Browse\\' tab at [952, 502] was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. The \\'Browse\\' screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\' and \\'SDCARD\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to finding the specified video files, which is a prerequisite for creating the playlist.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Internal memory\\' folder icon, which is located under \\'Storages\\'. The text \\'Inte\\' is at [484, 188, 499, 252] and \\'nory\\' at [485, 59, 517, 135]. The center of the folder icon is approximately [459, 184]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Internal memory\\' directory, allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Internal memory\\' was successful. The screen changed to display the contents of the internal storage. This action brought the agent closer to finding the specified video files, which is a prerequisite for creating the playlist. The next step is to locate the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder within the \\'Internal memory\\'.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This is predicted to reveal more folders, hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' view. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which was previously not visible, is now visible at the bottom of the screen.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.43\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 796, 34, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 222], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 173, 97, 428], \\'text\\': \\'VLCVideos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [121, 38, 140, 675], \\'text\\': \\'Browser Internal memory VLCVideos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 32, 177, 120], \\'text\\': \\'{BEIaYmig\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [156, 172, 194, 701], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_05_clip_34_raw.mp4 1:49\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [230, 32, 239, 116], \\'text\\': \\'HeLPrZ4G\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [218, 170, 255, 548], \\'text\\': \\'final_clip_42_4K.mp4 2:04\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [293, 35, 299, 123], \\'text\\': \\'TE7utr2s\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [279, 172, 317, 776], \\'text\\': \\'highlight_41_4K2023_03_30.mp4 1.21\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [353, 32, 362, 137], \\'text\\': \\'hefucbusiZ\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [342, 171, 379, 598], \\'text\\': \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4 1:15\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [895, 818, 957, 967]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [333, 27, 387, 151]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 787, 101, 882]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 139, 100, 443]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 667, 100, 755]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 250, 37, 295]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 905, 101, 988]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 37, 237]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 146, 37, 184]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 794, 40, 950]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a playlist titled \"Ultimate Fails Series\" with the following files in VLC (located in Internal Memory/VLCVideos), in order: highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4, scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[221,50],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the checkbox next to \\'Internal memory\\'. The checkbox is located at approximately [221, 50], associated with the text \\'Internal memory\\' [200, 140, 239, 435]. This action is predicted to select \\'Internal memory\\' as a source for media files, which may trigger a media scan or enable further actions related to media management and playlist creation. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the checkbox next to \\'Internal memory\\' at [221, 50] was successful. The checkbox is now checked, indicating that \\'Internal memory\\' has been selected as a source for media files. No media scan was visibly initiated, nor did any confirmation or save buttons appear on the screen. The application remains on the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen. This step is a prerequisite for VLC to find media files, which in turn is necessary for creating playlists with those files.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,55],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located in the top left corner, approximately at [83, 55]. This action is predicted to navigate back from the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen to the previous screen, which is expected to be the \\'Playlists\\' tab. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow at [83, 55] was successful. The app navigated from the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' tab. The \\'Playlists\\' tab still displays \\'No media files found...\\'. This action brought the agent back to a previous screen, but it did not directly enable playlist creation. The next step is to try a different approach by using the \\'Browse\\' tab.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[952,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Browse\\' text is detected at [952, 448, 966, 556]. Tapping the center of the \\'Browse\\' tab at approximately [952, 502]. This is predicted to switch the view from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen, where file navigation can occur. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Browse\\' tab at [952, 502] was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. The \\'Browse\\' screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\' and \\'SDCARD\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to finding the specified video files, which is a prerequisite for creating the playlist.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Internal memory\\' folder icon, which is located under \\'Storages\\'. The text \\'Inte\\' is at [484, 188, 499, 252] and \\'nory\\' at [485, 59, 517, 135]. The center of the folder icon is approximately [459, 184]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Internal memory\\' directory, allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Internal memory\\' was successful. The screen changed to display the contents of the internal storage. This action brought the agent closer to finding the specified video files, which is a prerequisite for creating the playlist. The next step is to locate the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder within the \\'Internal memory\\'.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This is predicted to reveal more folders, hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' view. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which was previously not visible, is now visible at the bottom of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the target folder accessible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 14: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The text \\'VLCVideos\\' is detected at [920, 172, 939, 369]. Tapping at approximately [930, 270] which is the center of the text. This action is predicted to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder and display its contents. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The VLC application is open, and its main interface is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,55],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located in the top left corner, approximately at [83, 55]. This action is predicted to navigate back from the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen to the previous screen, which is expected to be the \\'Playlists\\' tab. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow at [83, 55] was successful. The app navigated from the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' tab. The \\'Playlists\\' tab still displays \\'No media files found...\\'. This action brought the agent back to a previous screen, but it did not directly enable playlist creation. The next step is to try a different approach by using the \\'Browse\\' tab.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[952,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Browse\\' text is detected at [952, 448, 966, 556]. Tapping the center of the \\'Browse\\' tab at approximately [952, 502]. This is predicted to switch the view from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen, where file navigation can occur. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Browse\\' tab at [952, 502] was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. The \\'Browse\\' screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\' and \\'SDCARD\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to finding the specified video files, which is a prerequisite for creating the playlist.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Internal memory\\' folder icon, which is located under \\'Storages\\'. The text \\'Inte\\' is at [484, 188, 499, 252] and \\'nory\\' at [485, 59, 517, 135]. The center of the folder icon is approximately [459, 184]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Internal memory\\' directory, allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Internal memory\\' was successful. The screen changed to display the contents of the internal storage. This action brought the agent closer to finding the specified video files, which is a prerequisite for creating the playlist. The next step is to locate the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder within the \\'Internal memory\\'.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This is predicted to reveal more folders, hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' view. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which was previously not visible, is now visible at the bottom of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the target folder accessible.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The text \\'VLCVideos\\' is detected at [920, 172, 939, 369]. Tapping at approximately [930, 270] which is the center of the text. This action is predicted to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder at [930, 270] was successful. The screen changed from the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\' to display the contents of the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The files \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\' and \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\' are now visible. This action brings the agent closer to creating the playlist by making the required files accessible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.43\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 796, 34, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 222], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 173, 97, 428], \\'text\\': \\'VLCVideos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [121, 38, 140, 675], \\'text\\': \\'Browser Internal memory VLCVideos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 32, 177, 120], \\'text\\': \\'{BEIaYmig\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [156, 172, 194, 701], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_05_clip_34_raw.mp4 1:49\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [230, 32, 239, 116], \\'text\\': \\'HeLPrZ4G\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [218, 170, 255, 548], \\'text\\': \\'final_clip_42_4K.mp4 2:04\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [293, 35, 299, 123], \\'text\\': \\'TE7utr2s\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [279, 172, 317, 776], \\'text\\': \\'highlight_41_4K2023_03_30.mp4 1.21\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [353, 32, 362, 137], \\'text\\': \\'hefucbusiZ\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [342, 171, 379, 598], \\'text\\': \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4 1:15\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [895, 818, 957, 967]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [333, 27, 387, 151]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 787, 101, 882]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 139, 100, 443]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 667, 100, 755]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 250, 37, 295]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 905, 101, 988]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 37, 237]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 146, 37, 184]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 794, 40, 950]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,55],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located in the top left corner, approximately at [83, 55]. This action is predicted to navigate back from the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen to the previous screen, which is expected to be the \\'Playlists\\' tab. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow at [83, 55] was successful. The app navigated from the \\'Select directories to include...\\' screen back to the \\'Playlists\\' tab. The \\'Playlists\\' tab still displays \\'No media files found...\\'. This action brought the agent back to a previous screen, but it did not directly enable playlist creation. The next step is to try a different approach by using the \\'Browse\\' tab.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[952,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Browse\\' text is detected at [952, 448, 966, 556]. Tapping the center of the \\'Browse\\' tab at approximately [952, 502]. This is predicted to switch the view from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen, where file navigation can occur. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Browse\\' tab at [952, 502] was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. The \\'Browse\\' screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\' and \\'SDCARD\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to finding the specified video files, which is a prerequisite for creating the playlist.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Internal memory\\' folder icon, which is located under \\'Storages\\'. The text \\'Inte\\' is at [484, 188, 499, 252] and \\'nory\\' at [485, 59, 517, 135]. The center of the folder icon is approximately [459, 184]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Internal memory\\' directory, allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Internal memory\\' was successful. The screen changed to display the contents of the internal storage. This action brought the agent closer to finding the specified video files, which is a prerequisite for creating the playlist. The next step is to locate the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder within the \\'Internal memory\\'.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This is predicted to reveal more folders, hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' view. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which was previously not visible, is now visible at the bottom of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the target folder accessible.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The text \\'VLCVideos\\' is detected at [920, 172, 939, 369]. Tapping at approximately [930, 270] which is the center of the text. This action is predicted to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder at [930, 270] was successful. The screen changed from the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\' to display the contents of the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The files \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\' and \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\' are now visible. This action brings the agent closer to creating the playlist by making the required files accessible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 15: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[298,474],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\'. The text for this file is located at [279, 172, 317, 776]. The long-press will be performed at approximately [298, 474]. This is predicted to select the file and/or open a context menu with options related to playlist management. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The VLC application is open, and its main interface is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[952,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Browse\\' text is detected at [952, 448, 966, 556]. Tapping the center of the \\'Browse\\' tab at approximately [952, 502]. This is predicted to switch the view from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen, where file navigation can occur. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Browse\\' tab at [952, 502] was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. The \\'Browse\\' screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\' and \\'SDCARD\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to finding the specified video files, which is a prerequisite for creating the playlist.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Internal memory\\' folder icon, which is located under \\'Storages\\'. The text \\'Inte\\' is at [484, 188, 499, 252] and \\'nory\\' at [485, 59, 517, 135]. The center of the folder icon is approximately [459, 184]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Internal memory\\' directory, allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Internal memory\\' was successful. The screen changed to display the contents of the internal storage. This action brought the agent closer to finding the specified video files, which is a prerequisite for creating the playlist. The next step is to locate the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder within the \\'Internal memory\\'.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This is predicted to reveal more folders, hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' view. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which was previously not visible, is now visible at the bottom of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the target folder accessible.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The text \\'VLCVideos\\' is detected at [920, 172, 939, 369]. Tapping at approximately [930, 270] which is the center of the text. This action is predicted to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder at [930, 270] was successful. The screen changed from the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\' to display the contents of the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The files \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\' and \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\' are now visible. This action brings the agent closer to creating the playlist by making the required files accessible.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[298,474],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\'. The text for this file is located at [279, 172, 317, 776]. The long-press will be performed at approximately [298, 474]. This is predicted to select the file and/or open a context menu with options related to playlist management. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\' at [298, 474] was successful. The file is now visually selected (highlighted in orange). A new contextual top bar appeared, showing \\'1 selected\\' and icons for info, play, delete, and a three-dot menu. This change indicates that the file selection mode is active, which is a necessary step towards adding it to a playlist. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling further actions on the selected file.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.43\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 796, 34, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 74], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 211, 97, 406], \\'text\\': \\'selected\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [120, 38, 140, 675], \\'text\\': \\'Browser Internal memory VLCVideos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 32, 178, 120], \\'text\\': \\'meeheymh\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [156, 172, 194, 701], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_05_clip_34_raw.mp4 1:49\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [230, 32, 239, 116], \\'text\\': \\'HeLPrZ4G\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [218, 170, 255, 548], \\'text\\': \\'final_clip_42_4K.mp4 2:04\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [293, 33, 299, 123], \\'text\\': \\'T7utir2s\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [279, 172, 317, 776], \\'text\\': \\'highlight_41_4K2023_03_30.mp4 1.21\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [353, 32, 362, 137], \\'text\\': \\'hefucbusiZ\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [342, 170, 379, 598], \\'text\\': \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4 1:15\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 480, 102, 561]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 249, 36, 295]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 143, 35, 185]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 196, 36, 237]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 144, 103, 431]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 590, 116, 718]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[952,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Browse\\' text is detected at [952, 448, 966, 556]. Tapping the center of the \\'Browse\\' tab at approximately [952, 502]. This is predicted to switch the view from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen, where file navigation can occur. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Browse\\' tab at [952, 502] was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. The \\'Browse\\' screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\' and \\'SDCARD\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to finding the specified video files, which is a prerequisite for creating the playlist.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Internal memory\\' folder icon, which is located under \\'Storages\\'. The text \\'Inte\\' is at [484, 188, 499, 252] and \\'nory\\' at [485, 59, 517, 135]. The center of the folder icon is approximately [459, 184]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Internal memory\\' directory, allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Internal memory\\' was successful. The screen changed to display the contents of the internal storage. This action brought the agent closer to finding the specified video files, which is a prerequisite for creating the playlist. The next step is to locate the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder within the \\'Internal memory\\'.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This is predicted to reveal more folders, hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' view. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which was previously not visible, is now visible at the bottom of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the target folder accessible.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The text \\'VLCVideos\\' is detected at [920, 172, 939, 369]. Tapping at approximately [930, 270] which is the center of the text. This action is predicted to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder at [930, 270] was successful. The screen changed from the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\' to display the contents of the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The files \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\' and \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\' are now visible. This action brings the agent closer to creating the playlist by making the required files accessible.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[298,474],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\'. The text for this file is located at [279, 172, 317, 776]. The long-press will be performed at approximately [298, 474]. This is predicted to select the file and/or open a context menu with options related to playlist management. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\' at [298, 474] was successful. The file is now visually selected (highlighted in orange). A new contextual top bar appeared, showing \\'1 selected\\' and icons for info, play, delete, and a three-dot menu. This change indicates that the file selection mode is active, which is a necessary step towards adding it to a playlist. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling further actions on the selected file.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 16: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,930],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located on the far right of the top contextual bar. The top bar currently shows \\'1 selected\\'. This action is predicted to open a dropdown menu with more options for the selected file, including options related to playlist management. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The VLC application is open, and its main interface is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Internal memory\\' folder icon, which is located under \\'Storages\\'. The text \\'Inte\\' is at [484, 188, 499, 252] and \\'nory\\' at [485, 59, 517, 135]. The center of the folder icon is approximately [459, 184]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Internal memory\\' directory, allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Internal memory\\' was successful. The screen changed to display the contents of the internal storage. This action brought the agent closer to finding the specified video files, which is a prerequisite for creating the playlist. The next step is to locate the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder within the \\'Internal memory\\'.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This is predicted to reveal more folders, hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' view. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which was previously not visible, is now visible at the bottom of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the target folder accessible.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The text \\'VLCVideos\\' is detected at [920, 172, 939, 369]. Tapping at approximately [930, 270] which is the center of the text. This action is predicted to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder at [930, 270] was successful. The screen changed from the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\' to display the contents of the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The files \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\' and \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\' are now visible. This action brings the agent closer to creating the playlist by making the required files accessible.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[298,474],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\'. The text for this file is located at [279, 172, 317, 776]. The long-press will be performed at approximately [298, 474]. This is predicted to select the file and/or open a context menu with options related to playlist management. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\' at [298, 474] was successful. The file is now visually selected (highlighted in orange). A new contextual top bar appeared, showing \\'1 selected\\' and icons for info, play, delete, and a three-dot menu. This change indicates that the file selection mode is active, which is a necessary step towards adding it to a playlist. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling further actions on the selected file.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,930],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located on the far right of the top contextual bar. The top bar currently shows \\'1 selected\\'. This action is predicted to open a dropdown menu with more options for the selected file, including options related to playlist management. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [85, 930] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen. This menu includes the options \\'Add to new playlist\\' and \\'Add to existing playlist\\', as well as a text input field for \\'Playlist name\\' and a \\'SAVE\\' button. This outcome directly enables the creation of a new playlist and completes Subgoal 2.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Internal memory\\' folder icon, which is located under \\'Storages\\'. The text \\'Inte\\' is at [484, 188, 499, 252] and \\'nory\\' at [485, 59, 517, 135]. The center of the folder icon is approximately [459, 184]. This action is predicted to open the \\'Internal memory\\' directory, allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Internal memory\\' was successful. The screen changed to display the contents of the internal storage. This action brought the agent closer to finding the specified video files, which is a prerequisite for creating the playlist. The next step is to locate the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder within the \\'Internal memory\\'.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This is predicted to reveal more folders, hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' view. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which was previously not visible, is now visible at the bottom of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the target folder accessible.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The text \\'VLCVideos\\' is detected at [920, 172, 939, 369]. Tapping at approximately [930, 270] which is the center of the text. This action is predicted to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder at [930, 270] was successful. The screen changed from the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\' to display the contents of the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The files \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\' and \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\' are now visible. This action brings the agent closer to creating the playlist by making the required files accessible.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[298,474],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\'. The text for this file is located at [279, 172, 317, 776]. The long-press will be performed at approximately [298, 474]. This is predicted to select the file and/or open a context menu with options related to playlist management. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\' at [298, 474] was successful. The file is now visually selected (highlighted in orange). A new contextual top bar appeared, showing \\'1 selected\\' and icons for info, play, delete, and a three-dot menu. This change indicates that the file selection mode is active, which is a necessary step towards adding it to a playlist. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling further actions on the selected file.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,930],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located on the far right of the top contextual bar. The top bar currently shows \\'1 selected\\'. This action is predicted to open a dropdown menu with more options for the selected file, including options related to playlist management. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [85, 930] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen. This menu includes the options \\'Add to new playlist\\' and \\'Add to existing playlist\\', as well as a text input field for \\'Playlist name\\' and a \\'SAVE\\' button. This outcome directly enables the creation of a new playlist and completes Subgoal 2.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 17: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,412],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text input field. The text \\'Playlist name\\' is detected at `[834, 56, 855, 296]`. The bounding box for the input field itself is `[812, 12, 876, 813]`. Tapping at approximately `[844, 412]` (center of the input field). This action is predicted to focus the text input field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text entry. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The VLC application is open, and its main interface is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is predicted to reveal more folders, hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' view. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which was previously not visible, is now visible at the bottom of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the target folder accessible.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The text \\'VLCVideos\\' is detected at [920, 172, 939, 369]. Tapping at approximately [930, 270] which is the center of the text. This action is predicted to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder at [930, 270] was successful. The screen changed from the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\' to display the contents of the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The files \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\' and \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\' are now visible. This action brings the agent closer to creating the playlist by making the required files accessible.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[298,474],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\'. The text for this file is located at [279, 172, 317, 776]. The long-press will be performed at approximately [298, 474]. This is predicted to select the file and/or open a context menu with options related to playlist management. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\' at [298, 474] was successful. The file is now visually selected (highlighted in orange). A new contextual top bar appeared, showing \\'1 selected\\' and icons for info, play, delete, and a three-dot menu. This change indicates that the file selection mode is active, which is a necessary step towards adding it to a playlist. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling further actions on the selected file.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,930],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located on the far right of the top contextual bar. The top bar currently shows \\'1 selected\\'. This action is predicted to open a dropdown menu with more options for the selected file, including options related to playlist management. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [85, 930] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen. This menu includes the options \\'Add to new playlist\\' and \\'Add to existing playlist\\', as well as a text input field for \\'Playlist name\\' and a \\'SAVE\\' button. This outcome directly enables the creation of a new playlist and completes Subgoal 2.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,412],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text input field. The text \\'Playlist name\\' is detected at `[834, 56, 855, 296]`. The bounding box for the input field itself is `[812, 12, 876, 813]`. Tapping at approximately `[844, 412]` (center of the input field). This action is predicted to focus the text input field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text entry. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlist name\\' text input field at `[844, 412]` was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'. The placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\' is still visible in the input field. This action successfully prepared the interface for text input, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the playlist.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a playlist titled \"Ultimate Fails Series\" with the following files in VLC (located in Internal Memory/VLCVideos), in order: highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4, scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500] to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This is predicted to reveal more folders, hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' view. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which was previously not visible, is now visible at the bottom of the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the target folder accessible.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The text \\'VLCVideos\\' is detected at [920, 172, 939, 369]. Tapping at approximately [930, 270] which is the center of the text. This action is predicted to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder at [930, 270] was successful. The screen changed from the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\' to display the contents of the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The files \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\' and \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\' are now visible. This action brings the agent closer to creating the playlist by making the required files accessible.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[298,474],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\'. The text for this file is located at [279, 172, 317, 776]. The long-press will be performed at approximately [298, 474]. This is predicted to select the file and/or open a context menu with options related to playlist management. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\' at [298, 474] was successful. The file is now visually selected (highlighted in orange). A new contextual top bar appeared, showing \\'1 selected\\' and icons for info, play, delete, and a three-dot menu. This change indicates that the file selection mode is active, which is a necessary step towards adding it to a playlist. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling further actions on the selected file.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,930],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located on the far right of the top contextual bar. The top bar currently shows \\'1 selected\\'. This action is predicted to open a dropdown menu with more options for the selected file, including options related to playlist management. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [85, 930] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen. This menu includes the options \\'Add to new playlist\\' and \\'Add to existing playlist\\', as well as a text input field for \\'Playlist name\\' and a \\'SAVE\\' button. This outcome directly enables the creation of a new playlist and completes Subgoal 2.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,412],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text input field. The text \\'Playlist name\\' is detected at `[834, 56, 855, 296]`. The bounding box for the input field itself is `[812, 12, 876, 813]`. Tapping at approximately `[844, 412]` (center of the input field). This action is predicted to focus the text input field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text entry. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlist name\\' text input field at `[844, 412]` was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'. The placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\' is still visible in the input field. This action successfully prepared the interface for text input, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 18: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ultimate Fails Series\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains the placeholder \\'Playlist name\\'. This action will replace the placeholder with the new text. The predicted outcome is that the text field will now display \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The VLC application is open, and its main interface is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"Ultimate Fails Series\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.46\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 796, 34, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'[Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'[Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 710, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 173, 97, 428], \\'text\\': \\'VLCVideos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [120, 38, 140, 675], \\'text\\': \\'Browser Internal memory VLCVideos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 32, 178, 120], \\'text\\': \\'829062\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [157, 173, 194, 701], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_05_clip_34_raw.mp4 1:49\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [230, 32, 239, 116], \\'text\\': \\'HSEPFZAE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [218, 170, 255, 548], \\'text\\': \\'final_clip_42_4K.mp4 2:04\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [292, 33, 299, 123], \\'text\\': \\'Fro\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [280, 173, 317, 775], \\'text\\': \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4 1.21\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [354, 32, 363, 137], \\'text\\': \\'208\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [342, 170, 379, 598], \\'text\\': \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4 1:15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [756, 20, 797, 398], \\'text\\': \\'Add to new playlist media\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [808, 57, 823, 249], \\'text\\': \\'Playlist name\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [833, 54, 855, 407], \\'text\\': \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [836, 853, 852, 954], \\'text\\': \\'SAVE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [903, 20, 948, 655], \\'text\\': \\'Add to existing playlist ADB Keyboard {ON}\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [811, 13, 876, 812]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [813, 810, 877, 997]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 668, 108, 753]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [346, 913, 374, 977]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 248, 36, 295]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [117, 202, 141, 467]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 797, 99, 873]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [285, 912, 312, 978]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [224, 914, 249, 976]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nThe virtual keyboard is visible; therefore, text input is possible.For text operations or search, the XML data about the current text field is of utmost importance: index=\"2\", text=\"Ultimate Fails Serie\", resource-id=\"\", class=\"android.widget.EditText\", package=\"org.videolan.vlc\", content-desc=\"\", checkable=\"false\", checked=\"false\", clickable=\"true\", enabled=\"true\", focusable=\"true\", focused=\"true\", scrollable=\"false\", long-clickable=\"true\", password=\"false\", selected=\"false\", bounds=\"[21,1949][870,2096]\" This is the currently selected text field you send input to or delete text from. The text you can edit is: \"Ultimate Fails Serie\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a playlist titled \"Ultimate Fails Series\" with the following files in VLC (located in Internal Memory/VLCVideos), in order: highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4, scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The text \\'VLCVideos\\' is detected at [920, 172, 939, 369]. Tapping at approximately [930, 270] which is the center of the text. This action is predicted to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder at [930, 270] was successful. The screen changed from the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\' to display the contents of the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The files \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\' and \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\' are now visible. This action brings the agent closer to creating the playlist by making the required files accessible.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[298,474],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\'. The text for this file is located at [279, 172, 317, 776]. The long-press will be performed at approximately [298, 474]. This is predicted to select the file and/or open a context menu with options related to playlist management. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\' at [298, 474] was successful. The file is now visually selected (highlighted in orange). A new contextual top bar appeared, showing \\'1 selected\\' and icons for info, play, delete, and a three-dot menu. This change indicates that the file selection mode is active, which is a necessary step towards adding it to a playlist. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling further actions on the selected file.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,930],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located on the far right of the top contextual bar. The top bar currently shows \\'1 selected\\'. This action is predicted to open a dropdown menu with more options for the selected file, including options related to playlist management. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [85, 930] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen. This menu includes the options \\'Add to new playlist\\' and \\'Add to existing playlist\\', as well as a text input field for \\'Playlist name\\' and a \\'SAVE\\' button. This outcome directly enables the creation of a new playlist and completes Subgoal 2.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,412],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text input field. The text \\'Playlist name\\' is detected at `[834, 56, 855, 296]`. The bounding box for the input field itself is `[812, 12, 876, 813]`. Tapping at approximately `[844, 412]` (center of the input field). This action is predicted to focus the text input field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text entry. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlist name\\' text input field at `[844, 412]` was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'. The placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\' is still visible in the input field. This action successfully prepared the interface for text input, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the playlist.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ultimate Fails Series\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains the placeholder \\'Playlist name\\'. This action will replace the placeholder with the new text. The predicted outcome is that the text field will now display \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\', as shown in the second screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, which is to name the new playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 19: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' key event to delete the last character (\\'l\\') from the text \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\' in the focused \\'Playlist name\\' input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\'. This action is predicted to change the text in the field to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The VLC application is open, and its main interface is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[298,474],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\'. The text for this file is located at [279, 172, 317, 776]. The long-press will be performed at approximately [298, 474]. This is predicted to select the file and/or open a context menu with options related to playlist management. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\' at [298, 474] was successful. The file is now visually selected (highlighted in orange). A new contextual top bar appeared, showing \\'1 selected\\' and icons for info, play, delete, and a three-dot menu. This change indicates that the file selection mode is active, which is a necessary step towards adding it to a playlist. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling further actions on the selected file.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,930],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located on the far right of the top contextual bar. The top bar currently shows \\'1 selected\\'. This action is predicted to open a dropdown menu with more options for the selected file, including options related to playlist management. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [85, 930] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen. This menu includes the options \\'Add to new playlist\\' and \\'Add to existing playlist\\', as well as a text input field for \\'Playlist name\\' and a \\'SAVE\\' button. This outcome directly enables the creation of a new playlist and completes Subgoal 2.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,412],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text input field. The text \\'Playlist name\\' is detected at `[834, 56, 855, 296]`. The bounding box for the input field itself is `[812, 12, 876, 813]`. Tapping at approximately `[844, 412]` (center of the input field). This action is predicted to focus the text input field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text entry. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlist name\\' text input field at `[844, 412]` was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'. The placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\' is still visible in the input field. This action successfully prepared the interface for text input, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the playlist.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ultimate Fails Series\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains the placeholder \\'Playlist name\\'. This action will replace the placeholder with the new text. The predicted outcome is that the text field will now display \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\', as shown in the second screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, which is to name the new playlist.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' key event to delete the last character (\\'l\\') from the text \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\' in the focused \\'Playlist name\\' input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\'. This action is predicted to change the text in the field to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action was successful. It deleted the last character from the \\'Playlist name\\' text field, changing the text from \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\' to \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\'. The text field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action corrected part of the typo but the playlist name is still not the target \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. The next step is to append the missing \\'s\\'.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"Ultimate Fails Serie\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[298,474],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\'. The text for this file is located at [279, 172, 317, 776]. The long-press will be performed at approximately [298, 474]. This is predicted to select the file and/or open a context menu with options related to playlist management. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\' at [298, 474] was successful. The file is now visually selected (highlighted in orange). A new contextual top bar appeared, showing \\'1 selected\\' and icons for info, play, delete, and a three-dot menu. This change indicates that the file selection mode is active, which is a necessary step towards adding it to a playlist. The action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling further actions on the selected file.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,930],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located on the far right of the top contextual bar. The top bar currently shows \\'1 selected\\'. This action is predicted to open a dropdown menu with more options for the selected file, including options related to playlist management. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [85, 930] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen. This menu includes the options \\'Add to new playlist\\' and \\'Add to existing playlist\\', as well as a text input field for \\'Playlist name\\' and a \\'SAVE\\' button. This outcome directly enables the creation of a new playlist and completes Subgoal 2.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,412],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text input field. The text \\'Playlist name\\' is detected at `[834, 56, 855, 296]`. The bounding box for the input field itself is `[812, 12, 876, 813]`. Tapping at approximately `[844, 412]` (center of the input field). This action is predicted to focus the text input field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text entry. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlist name\\' text input field at `[844, 412]` was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'. The placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\' is still visible in the input field. This action successfully prepared the interface for text input, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the playlist.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ultimate Fails Series\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains the placeholder \\'Playlist name\\'. This action will replace the placeholder with the new text. The predicted outcome is that the text field will now display \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\', as shown in the second screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, which is to name the new playlist.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' key event to delete the last character (\\'l\\') from the text \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\' in the focused \\'Playlist name\\' input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\'. This action is predicted to change the text in the field to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action was successful. It deleted the last character from the \\'Playlist name\\' text field, changing the text from \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\' to \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\'. The text field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action corrected part of the typo but the playlist name is still not the target \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. The next step is to append the missing \\'s\\'.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 20: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"s\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the character \\'s\\' to the text \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\' in the focused \\'Playlist name\\' input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\'. This action is predicted to change the text in the field to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The VLC application is open, and its main interface is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [85, 930] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen. This menu includes the options \\'Add to new playlist\\' and \\'Add to existing playlist\\', as well as a text input field for \\'Playlist name\\' and a \\'SAVE\\' button. This outcome directly enables the creation of a new playlist and completes Subgoal 2.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The text \\'Playlist name\\' is detected at `[834, 56, 855, 296]`. The bounding box for the input field itself is `[812, 12, 876, 813]`. Tapping at approximately `[844, 412]` (center of the input field). This action is predicted to focus the text input field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text entry. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlist name\\' text input field at `[844, 412]` was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'. The placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\' is still visible in the input field. This action successfully prepared the interface for text input, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the playlist.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ultimate Fails Series\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains the placeholder \\'Playlist name\\'. This action will replace the placeholder with the new text. The predicted outcome is that the text field will now display \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\', as shown in the second screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, which is to name the new playlist.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' key event to delete the last character (\\'l\\') from the text \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\' in the focused \\'Playlist name\\' input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\'. This action is predicted to change the text in the field to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action was successful. It deleted the last character from the \\'Playlist name\\' text field, changing the text from \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\' to \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\'. The text field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action corrected part of the typo but the playlist name is still not the target \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. The next step is to append the missing \\'s\\'.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"s\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the character \\'s\\' to the text \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\' in the focused \\'Playlist name\\' input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\'. This action is predicted to change the text in the field to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of appending \\'s\\' to the \\'Playlist name\\' field was successful. The text in the input field changed from \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\' to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. The text field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action successfully corrected the playlist name and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"Ultimate Fails Series\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"Ultimate Fails Series\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,930],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located on the far right of the top contextual bar. The top bar currently shows \\'1 selected\\'. This action is predicted to open a dropdown menu with more options for the selected file, including options related to playlist management. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [85, 930] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen. This menu includes the options \\'Add to new playlist\\' and \\'Add to existing playlist\\', as well as a text input field for \\'Playlist name\\' and a \\'SAVE\\' button. This outcome directly enables the creation of a new playlist and completes Subgoal 2.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,412],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text input field. The text \\'Playlist name\\' is detected at `[834, 56, 855, 296]`. The bounding box for the input field itself is `[812, 12, 876, 813]`. Tapping at approximately `[844, 412]` (center of the input field). This action is predicted to focus the text input field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text entry. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlist name\\' text input field at `[844, 412]` was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'. The placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\' is still visible in the input field. This action successfully prepared the interface for text input, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the playlist.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ultimate Fails Series\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains the placeholder \\'Playlist name\\'. This action will replace the placeholder with the new text. The predicted outcome is that the text field will now display \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\', as shown in the second screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, which is to name the new playlist.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' key event to delete the last character (\\'l\\') from the text \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\' in the focused \\'Playlist name\\' input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\'. This action is predicted to change the text in the field to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action was successful. It deleted the last character from the \\'Playlist name\\' text field, changing the text from \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\' to \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\'. The text field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action corrected part of the typo but the playlist name is still not the target \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. The next step is to append the missing \\'s\\'.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"s\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the character \\'s\\' to the text \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\' in the focused \\'Playlist name\\' input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\'. This action is predicted to change the text in the field to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of appending \\'s\\' to the \\'Playlist name\\' field was successful. The text in the input field changed from \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\' to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. The text field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action successfully corrected the playlist name and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 21: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button. The button is located to the right of the \\'Playlist name\\' input field and currently displays the text \\'SAVE\\'. This action is predicted to create the new playlist with the name \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' and add the initially selected video (\\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\') to it. The dialog for creating a new playlist should close, and the screen might navigate to the newly created playlist view or back to the video list.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,412],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text input field. The text \\'Playlist name\\' is detected at `[834, 56, 855, 296]`. The bounding box for the input field itself is `[812, 12, 876, 813]`. Tapping at approximately `[844, 412]` (center of the input field). This action is predicted to focus the text input field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text entry. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlist name\\' text input field at `[844, 412]` was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'. The placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\' is still visible in the input field. This action successfully prepared the interface for text input, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the playlist.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ultimate Fails Series\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains the placeholder \\'Playlist name\\'. This action will replace the placeholder with the new text. The predicted outcome is that the text field will now display \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\', as shown in the second screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, which is to name the new playlist.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' key event to delete the last character (\\'l\\') from the text \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\' in the focused \\'Playlist name\\' input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\'. This action is predicted to change the text in the field to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action was successful. It deleted the last character from the \\'Playlist name\\' text field, changing the text from \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\' to \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\'. The text field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action corrected part of the typo but the playlist name is still not the target \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. The next step is to append the missing \\'s\\'.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"s\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the character \\'s\\' to the text \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\' in the focused \\'Playlist name\\' input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\'. This action is predicted to change the text in the field to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of appending \\'s\\' to the \\'Playlist name\\' field was successful. The text in the input field changed from \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\' to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. The text field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action successfully corrected the playlist name and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button. The button is located to the right of the \\'Playlist name\\' input field and currently displays the text \\'SAVE\\'. This action is predicted to create the new playlist with the name \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' and add the initially selected video (\\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\') to it. The dialog for creating a new playlist should close, and the screen might navigate to the newly created playlist view or back to the video list. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button at [844, 903] was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the application returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This indicates that the playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' was created. It is highly probable that the video \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\', which was selected when the \\'Add to new playlist\\' option was chosen, has been automatically added to this newly created playlist. This action completes Subgoal 3.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 44, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.47\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 796, 34, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 222], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 173, 97, 428], \\'text\\': \\'VLCVideos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [121, 38, 140, 675], \\'text\\': \\'Browser Internal memory VLCVideos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 32, 177, 120], \\'text\\': \\'#BEIaYmig\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [156, 172, 194, 701], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_05_clip_34_raw.mp4 1:49\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [230, 32, 239, 116], \\'text\\': \\'HeLPrZ4G\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [218, 170, 255, 548], \\'text\\': \\'final_clip_42_4K.mp4 2:04\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [293, 35, 299, 123], \\'text\\': \\'Tqutakr2S\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [279, 172, 317, 776], \\'text\\': \\'highlight_41_4K2023_03_30.mp4 1.21\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [353, 32, 362, 137], \\'text\\': \\'hefucbusiZ\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [342, 170, 379, 598], \\'text\\': \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4 1:15\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [333, 27, 387, 151]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [895, 817, 957, 967]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 787, 101, 882]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 138, 100, 443]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 667, 100, 755]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 250, 37, 295]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 904, 101, 987]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 37, 237]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 145, 37, 184]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 793, 39, 951]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,412],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text input field. The text \\'Playlist name\\' is detected at `[834, 56, 855, 296]`. The bounding box for the input field itself is `[812, 12, 876, 813]`. Tapping at approximately `[844, 412]` (center of the input field). This action is predicted to focus the text input field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text entry. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Playlist name\\' text input field at `[844, 412]` was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by \\'ADB Keyboard (ON)\\'. The placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\' is still visible in the input field. This action successfully prepared the interface for text input, bringing the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of naming the playlist.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ultimate Fails Series\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains the placeholder \\'Playlist name\\'. This action will replace the placeholder with the new text. The predicted outcome is that the text field will now display \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\', as shown in the second screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, which is to name the new playlist.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' key event to delete the last character (\\'l\\') from the text \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\' in the focused \\'Playlist name\\' input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\'. This action is predicted to change the text in the field to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action was successful. It deleted the last character from the \\'Playlist name\\' text field, changing the text from \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\' to \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\'. The text field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action corrected part of the typo but the playlist name is still not the target \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. The next step is to append the missing \\'s\\'.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"s\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the character \\'s\\' to the text \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\' in the focused \\'Playlist name\\' input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\'. This action is predicted to change the text in the field to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of appending \\'s\\' to the \\'Playlist name\\' field was successful. The text in the input field changed from \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\' to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. The text field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action successfully corrected the playlist name and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button. The button is located to the right of the \\'Playlist name\\' input field and currently displays the text \\'SAVE\\'. This action is predicted to create the new playlist with the name \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' and add the initially selected video (\\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\') to it. The dialog for creating a new playlist should close, and the screen might navigate to the newly created playlist view or back to the video list. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button at [844, 903] was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the application returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This indicates that the playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' was created. It is highly probable that the video \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\', which was selected when the \\'Add to new playlist\\' option was chosen, has been automatically added to this newly created playlist. This action completes Subgoal 3.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 22: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon located at the top-left of the screen, to the left of \\'VLCVideos\\'. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to navigate back from the current \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, potentially to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view or the main VLC screen where different sections like \\'Playlists\\' can be accessed. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The VLC application is open, and its main interface is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action corrected part of the typo but the playlist name is still not the target \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. The next step is to append the missing \\'s\\'.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"s\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the character \\'s\\' to the text \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\' in the focused \\'Playlist name\\' input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\'. This action is predicted to change the text in the field to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of appending \\'s\\' to the \\'Playlist name\\' field was successful. The text in the input field changed from \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\' to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. The text field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action successfully corrected the playlist name and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button. The button is located to the right of the \\'Playlist name\\' input field and currently displays the text \\'SAVE\\'. This action is predicted to create the new playlist with the name \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' and add the initially selected video (\\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\') to it. The dialog for creating a new playlist should close, and the screen might navigate to the newly created playlist view or back to the video list. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button at [844, 903] was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the application returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This indicates that the playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' was created. It is highly probable that the video \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\', which was selected when the \\'Add to new playlist\\' option was chosen, has been automatically added to this newly created playlist. This action completes Subgoal 3.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon located at the top-left of the screen, to the left of \\'VLCVideos\\'. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to navigate back from the current \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, potentially to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view or the main VLC screen where different sections like \\'Playlists\\' can be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon at [85, 60] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view to the main \\'Browse\\' screen of VLC. This screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\', \\'Local Network\\', and a bottom navigation bar.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field currently contains the placeholder \\'Playlist name\\'. This action will replace the placeholder with the new text. The predicted outcome is that the text field will now display \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\', as shown in the second screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3, which is to name the new playlist.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' key event to delete the last character (\\'l\\') from the text \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\' in the focused \\'Playlist name\\' input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\'. This action is predicted to change the text in the field to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action was successful. It deleted the last character from the \\'Playlist name\\' text field, changing the text from \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\' to \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\'. The text field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action corrected part of the typo but the playlist name is still not the target \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. The next step is to append the missing \\'s\\'.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"s\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the character \\'s\\' to the text \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\' in the focused \\'Playlist name\\' input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\'. This action is predicted to change the text in the field to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of appending \\'s\\' to the \\'Playlist name\\' field was successful. The text in the input field changed from \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\' to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. The text field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action successfully corrected the playlist name and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button. The button is located to the right of the \\'Playlist name\\' input field and currently displays the text \\'SAVE\\'. This action is predicted to create the new playlist with the name \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' and add the initially selected video (\\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\') to it. The dialog for creating a new playlist should close, and the screen might navigate to the newly created playlist view or back to the video list. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button at [844, 903] was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the application returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This indicates that the playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' was created. It is highly probable that the video \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\', which was selected when the \\'Add to new playlist\\' option was chosen, has been automatically added to this newly created playlist. This action completes Subgoal 3.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon located at the top-left of the screen, to the left of \\'VLCVideos\\'. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to navigate back from the current \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, potentially to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view or the main VLC screen where different sections like \\'Playlists\\' can be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon at [85, 60] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view to the main \\'Browse\\' screen of VLC. This screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\', \\'Local Network\\', and a bottom navigation bar. This action allows the agent to proceed with navigating to the \\'Playlists\\' section to verify the contents of the newly created playlist, which is a necessary step for Subgoal 4.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 23: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab located at the bottom of the screen. The text \\'Playlists\\' is detected with bounding box [952, 638, 967, 763]. Tapping on the center of this text will navigate to the Playlists screen. This action is predicted to display a list of existing playlists, where I can then look for \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The VLC application is open, and its main interface is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_DEL\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Send a \\'KEYCODE_DEL\\' key event to delete the last character (\\'l\\') from the text \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\' in the focused \\'Playlist name\\' input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\'. This action is predicted to change the text in the field to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action was successful. It deleted the last character from the \\'Playlist name\\' text field, changing the text from \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\' to \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\'. The text field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action corrected part of the typo but the playlist name is still not the target \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. The next step is to append the missing \\'s\\'.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"s\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the character \\'s\\' to the text \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\' in the focused \\'Playlist name\\' input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\'. This action is predicted to change the text in the field to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of appending \\'s\\' to the \\'Playlist name\\' field was successful. The text in the input field changed from \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\' to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. The text field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action successfully corrected the playlist name and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button. The button is located to the right of the \\'Playlist name\\' input field and currently displays the text \\'SAVE\\'. This action is predicted to create the new playlist with the name \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' and add the initially selected video (\\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\') to it. The dialog for creating a new playlist should close, and the screen might navigate to the newly created playlist view or back to the video list. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button at [844, 903] was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the application returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This indicates that the playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' was created. It is highly probable that the video \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\', which was selected when the \\'Add to new playlist\\' option was chosen, has been automatically added to this newly created playlist. This action completes Subgoal 3.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon located at the top-left of the screen, to the left of \\'VLCVideos\\'. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to navigate back from the current \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, potentially to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view or the main VLC screen where different sections like \\'Playlists\\' can be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon at [85, 60] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view to the main \\'Browse\\' screen of VLC. This screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\', \\'Local Network\\', and a bottom navigation bar. This action allows the agent to proceed with navigating to the \\'Playlists\\' section to verify the contents of the newly created playlist, which is a necessary step for Subgoal 4.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab located at the bottom of the screen. The text \\'Playlists\\' is detected with bounding box [952, 638, 967, 763]. Tapping on the center of this text will navigate to the Playlists screen. This action is predicted to display a list of existing playlists, where I can then look for \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Playlists\\' screen now displays the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist, which shows \\'1 tracks\\'. This indicates that the playlist was created and likely contains the first video. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which involves verifying the content of this playlist.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.49\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 796, 35, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 222], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 156, 96, 251], \\'text\\': \\'VLC\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [244, 109, 271, 369], \\'text\\': \\'TL7MEKT2S\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [319, 392, 357, 473], \\'text\\': \\'0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [380, 45, 417, 377], \\'text\\': \\'Ultimate Fails Ser  tracks 1.21\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 59, 966, 143], \\'text\\': \\'Video\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 259, 966, 345], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 448, 966, 556], \\'text\\': \\'Browse\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 638, 967, 763], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 863, 967, 940], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [912, 604, 989, 803]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 212, 990, 385]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 812, 986, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [912, 397, 991, 601]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 5, 994, 196]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [319, 391, 357, 469]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 250, 37, 296]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 142, 37, 186]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 37, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [52, 845, 67, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 810, 99, 877]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 894, 102, 988]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 697, 97, 756]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [125, 42, 149, 86]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 787, 38, 952]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [384, 400, 422, 475]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [166, 39, 366, 493]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The field is currently focused and contains \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\'. This action is predicted to change the text in the field to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_DEL` action was successful. It deleted the last character from the \\'Playlist name\\' text field, changing the text from \\'Ultimate Fails Seriesl\\' to \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\'. The text field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action corrected part of the typo but the playlist name is still not the target \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. The next step is to append the missing \\'s\\'.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"s\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Append the character \\'s\\' to the text \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\' in the focused \\'Playlist name\\' input field. The field is currently focused and contains \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\'. This action is predicted to change the text in the field to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of appending \\'s\\' to the \\'Playlist name\\' field was successful. The text in the input field changed from \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\' to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. The text field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action successfully corrected the playlist name and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button. The button is located to the right of the \\'Playlist name\\' input field and currently displays the text \\'SAVE\\'. This action is predicted to create the new playlist with the name \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' and add the initially selected video (\\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\') to it. The dialog for creating a new playlist should close, and the screen might navigate to the newly created playlist view or back to the video list. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button at [844, 903] was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the application returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This indicates that the playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' was created. It is highly probable that the video \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\', which was selected when the \\'Add to new playlist\\' option was chosen, has been automatically added to this newly created playlist. This action completes Subgoal 3.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon located at the top-left of the screen, to the left of \\'VLCVideos\\'. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to navigate back from the current \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, potentially to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view or the main VLC screen where different sections like \\'Playlists\\' can be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon at [85, 60] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view to the main \\'Browse\\' screen of VLC. This screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\', \\'Local Network\\', and a bottom navigation bar. This action allows the agent to proceed with navigating to the \\'Playlists\\' section to verify the contents of the newly created playlist, which is a necessary step for Subgoal 4.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab located at the bottom of the screen. The text \\'Playlists\\' is detected with bounding box [952, 638, 967, 763]. Tapping on the center of this text will navigate to the Playlists screen. This action is predicted to display a list of existing playlists, where I can then look for \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Playlists\\' screen now displays the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist, which shows \\'1 tracks\\'. This indicates that the playlist was created and likely contains the first video. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which involves verifying the content of this playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 24: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,211],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist entry. The playlist entry is visible on the screen and shows \\'1 tracks\\'. This action is predicted to open the playlist, displaying its contents, which should include the video \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\'.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The field is currently focused and contains \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\'. This action is predicted to change the text in the field to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of appending \\'s\\' to the \\'Playlist name\\' field was successful. The text in the input field changed from \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\' to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. The text field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action successfully corrected the playlist name and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button. The button is located to the right of the \\'Playlist name\\' input field and currently displays the text \\'SAVE\\'. This action is predicted to create the new playlist with the name \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' and add the initially selected video (\\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\') to it. The dialog for creating a new playlist should close, and the screen might navigate to the newly created playlist view or back to the video list. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button at [844, 903] was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the application returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This indicates that the playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' was created. It is highly probable that the video \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\', which was selected when the \\'Add to new playlist\\' option was chosen, has been automatically added to this newly created playlist. This action completes Subgoal 3.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon located at the top-left of the screen, to the left of \\'VLCVideos\\'. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to navigate back from the current \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, potentially to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view or the main VLC screen where different sections like \\'Playlists\\' can be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon at [85, 60] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view to the main \\'Browse\\' screen of VLC. This screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\', \\'Local Network\\', and a bottom navigation bar. This action allows the agent to proceed with navigating to the \\'Playlists\\' section to verify the contents of the newly created playlist, which is a necessary step for Subgoal 4.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab located at the bottom of the screen. The text \\'Playlists\\' is detected with bounding box [952, 638, 967, 763]. Tapping on the center of this text will navigate to the Playlists screen. This action is predicted to display a list of existing playlists, where I can then look for \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Playlists\\' screen now displays the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist, which shows \\'1 tracks\\'. This indicates that the playlist was created and likely contains the first video. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which involves verifying the content of this playlist.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,211],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist entry. The playlist entry is visible on the screen and shows \\'1 tracks\\'. This action is predicted to open the playlist, displaying its contents, which should include the video \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist entry was successful. The application navigated to the playlist view, displaying \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' as the title and listing \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30\\' as a track within it. This confirms the first video was added to the playlist, completing Subgoal 4.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 42, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.49\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 796, 34, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 712, 65, 797], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 65, 948], \\'text\\': \\'Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [128, 388, 150, 847], \\'text\\': \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [161, 387, 177, 534], \\'text\\': \\'Imin 21s\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [178, 82, 197, 268], \\'text\\': \\'TL7IEKF2S\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [287, 98, 302, 195], \\'text\\': \\'PLAY\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [278, 306, 310, 490], \\'text\\': \\'= >\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [367, 174, 374, 263], \\'text\\': \\'TiFMtr2s\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [355, 321, 392, 836], \\'text\\': \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30 1.21\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [273, 35, 316, 259]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [346, 164, 401, 292]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 247, 37, 296]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 904, 103, 978]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 194, 36, 240]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [353, 897, 396, 987]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 140, 36, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [348, 26, 403, 145]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [273, 288, 317, 385]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [274, 417, 318, 505]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 791, 37, 943]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [124, 37, 267, 356]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [52, 847, 67, 1000]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The field is currently focused and contains \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\'. This action is predicted to change the text in the field to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of appending \\'s\\' to the \\'Playlist name\\' field was successful. The text in the input field changed from \\'Ultimate Fails Serie\\' to \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. The text field remains focused, and the virtual keyboard is still active. This action successfully corrected the playlist name and brought the agent closer to completing Subgoal 3.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button. The button is located to the right of the \\'Playlist name\\' input field and currently displays the text \\'SAVE\\'. This action is predicted to create the new playlist with the name \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' and add the initially selected video (\\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\') to it. The dialog for creating a new playlist should close, and the screen might navigate to the newly created playlist view or back to the video list. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button at [844, 903] was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the application returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This indicates that the playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' was created. It is highly probable that the video \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\', which was selected when the \\'Add to new playlist\\' option was chosen, has been automatically added to this newly created playlist. This action completes Subgoal 3.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon located at the top-left of the screen, to the left of \\'VLCVideos\\'. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to navigate back from the current \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, potentially to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view or the main VLC screen where different sections like \\'Playlists\\' can be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon at [85, 60] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view to the main \\'Browse\\' screen of VLC. This screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\', \\'Local Network\\', and a bottom navigation bar. This action allows the agent to proceed with navigating to the \\'Playlists\\' section to verify the contents of the newly created playlist, which is a necessary step for Subgoal 4.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab located at the bottom of the screen. The text \\'Playlists\\' is detected with bounding box [952, 638, 967, 763]. Tapping on the center of this text will navigate to the Playlists screen. This action is predicted to display a list of existing playlists, where I can then look for \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Playlists\\' screen now displays the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist, which shows \\'1 tracks\\'. This indicates that the playlist was created and likely contains the first video. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which involves verifying the content of this playlist.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,211],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist entry. The playlist entry is visible on the screen and shows \\'1 tracks\\'. This action is predicted to open the playlist, displaying its contents, which should include the video \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist entry was successful. The application navigated to the playlist view, displaying \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' as the title and listing \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30\\' as a track within it. This confirms the first video was added to the playlist, completing Subgoal 4.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 25: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top-left of the screen. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to navigate back from the current \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist view to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, where all playlists are listed.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button. The button is located to the right of the \\'Playlist name\\' input field and currently displays the text \\'SAVE\\'. This action is predicted to create the new playlist with the name \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' and add the initially selected video (\\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\') to it. The dialog for creating a new playlist should close, and the screen might navigate to the newly created playlist view or back to the video list. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button at [844, 903] was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the application returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This indicates that the playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' was created. It is highly probable that the video \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\', which was selected when the \\'Add to new playlist\\' option was chosen, has been automatically added to this newly created playlist. This action completes Subgoal 3.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon located at the top-left of the screen, to the left of \\'VLCVideos\\'. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to navigate back from the current \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, potentially to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view or the main VLC screen where different sections like \\'Playlists\\' can be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon at [85, 60] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view to the main \\'Browse\\' screen of VLC. This screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\', \\'Local Network\\', and a bottom navigation bar. This action allows the agent to proceed with navigating to the \\'Playlists\\' section to verify the contents of the newly created playlist, which is a necessary step for Subgoal 4.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab located at the bottom of the screen. The text \\'Playlists\\' is detected with bounding box [952, 638, 967, 763]. Tapping on the center of this text will navigate to the Playlists screen. This action is predicted to display a list of existing playlists, where I can then look for \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Playlists\\' screen now displays the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist, which shows \\'1 tracks\\'. This indicates that the playlist was created and likely contains the first video. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which involves verifying the content of this playlist.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,211],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist entry. The playlist entry is visible on the screen and shows \\'1 tracks\\'. This action is predicted to open the playlist, displaying its contents, which should include the video \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist entry was successful. The application navigated to the playlist view, displaying \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' as the title and listing \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30\\' as a track within it. This confirms the first video was added to the playlist, completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top-left of the screen. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to navigate back from the current \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist view to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, where all playlists are listed. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon at [85, 60] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen, which lists all available playlists. This action is a step towards being able to navigate to the video files to add the second video to the playlist.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.50\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 796, 34, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 156, 96, 251], \\'text\\': \\'VLC\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [244, 109, 271, 369], \\'text\\': \\'TL7MEKT2S\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [319, 392, 357, 473], \\'text\\': \\'0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [380, 45, 417, 377], \\'text\\': \\'Ultimate Fails Ser  tracks 1.21\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 59, 966, 143], \\'text\\': \\'Video\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 259, 966, 345], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 448, 966, 556], \\'text\\': \\'Browse\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 638, 967, 763], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 863, 967, 940], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [912, 604, 989, 803]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 212, 990, 385]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 812, 986, 984]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 5, 993, 196]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [912, 397, 991, 601]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [319, 391, 357, 469]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 250, 37, 296]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 143, 37, 186]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 37, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [52, 844, 67, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 810, 99, 877]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 894, 102, 987]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 697, 97, 755]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [125, 42, 149, 86]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 788, 38, 954]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [384, 400, 422, 475]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [166, 39, 366, 493]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button. The button is located to the right of the \\'Playlist name\\' input field and currently displays the text \\'SAVE\\'. This action is predicted to create the new playlist with the name \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' and add the initially selected video (\\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\') to it. The dialog for creating a new playlist should close, and the screen might navigate to the newly created playlist view or back to the video list. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'SAVE\\' button at [844, 903] was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the application returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This indicates that the playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' was created. It is highly probable that the video \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\', which was selected when the \\'Add to new playlist\\' option was chosen, has been automatically added to this newly created playlist. This action completes Subgoal 3.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon located at the top-left of the screen, to the left of \\'VLCVideos\\'. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to navigate back from the current \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, potentially to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view or the main VLC screen where different sections like \\'Playlists\\' can be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon at [85, 60] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view to the main \\'Browse\\' screen of VLC. This screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\', \\'Local Network\\', and a bottom navigation bar. This action allows the agent to proceed with navigating to the \\'Playlists\\' section to verify the contents of the newly created playlist, which is a necessary step for Subgoal 4.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab located at the bottom of the screen. The text \\'Playlists\\' is detected with bounding box [952, 638, 967, 763]. Tapping on the center of this text will navigate to the Playlists screen. This action is predicted to display a list of existing playlists, where I can then look for \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Playlists\\' screen now displays the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist, which shows \\'1 tracks\\'. This indicates that the playlist was created and likely contains the first video. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which involves verifying the content of this playlist.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,211],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist entry. The playlist entry is visible on the screen and shows \\'1 tracks\\'. This action is predicted to open the playlist, displaying its contents, which should include the video \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist entry was successful. The application navigated to the playlist view, displaying \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' as the title and listing \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30\\' as a track within it. This confirms the first video was added to the playlist, completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top-left of the screen. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to navigate back from the current \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist view to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, where all playlists are listed. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon at [85, 60] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen, which lists all available playlists. This action is a step towards being able to navigate to the video files to add the second video to the playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 26: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

The \\'Browse\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is predicted to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, allowing access to the file system to locate the video \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to navigate back from the current \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, potentially to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view or the main VLC screen where different sections like \\'Playlists\\' can be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon at [85, 60] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view to the main \\'Browse\\' screen of VLC. This screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\', \\'Local Network\\', and a bottom navigation bar. This action allows the agent to proceed with navigating to the \\'Playlists\\' section to verify the contents of the newly created playlist, which is a necessary step for Subgoal 4.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab located at the bottom of the screen. The text \\'Playlists\\' is detected with bounding box [952, 638, 967, 763]. Tapping on the center of this text will navigate to the Playlists screen. This action is predicted to display a list of existing playlists, where I can then look for \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Playlists\\' screen now displays the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist, which shows \\'1 tracks\\'. This indicates that the playlist was created and likely contains the first video. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which involves verifying the content of this playlist.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,211],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist entry.

This action is predicted to open the playlist, displaying its contents, which should include the video \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist entry was successful. The application navigated to the playlist view, displaying \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' as the title and listing \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30\\' as a track within it. This confirms the first video was added to the playlist, completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon at [85, 60] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen, which lists all available playlists. This action is a step towards being able to navigate to the video files to add the second video to the playlist.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Browse\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is predicted to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, allowing access to the file system to locate the video \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Browse\\' tab at [959, 502] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. This screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\' and \\'SDCARD\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5 by allowing navigation to the video files.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon located at the top-left of the screen, to the left of \\'VLCVideos\\'. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to navigate back from the current \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, potentially to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view or the main VLC screen where different sections like \\'Playlists\\' can be accessed. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon at [85, 60] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view to the main \\'Browse\\' screen of VLC. This screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\', \\'Local Network\\', and a bottom navigation bar. This action allows the agent to proceed with navigating to the \\'Playlists\\' section to verify the contents of the newly created playlist, which is a necessary step for Subgoal 4.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab located at the bottom of the screen. The text \\'Playlists\\' is detected with bounding box [952, 638, 967, 763]. Tapping on the center of this text will navigate to the Playlists screen. This action is predicted to display a list of existing playlists, where I can then look for \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Playlists\\' screen now displays the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist, which shows \\'1 tracks\\'. This indicates that the playlist was created and likely contains the first video. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which involves verifying the content of this playlist.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,211],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist entry. The playlist entry is visible on the screen and shows \\'1 tracks\\'. This action is predicted to open the playlist, displaying its contents, which should include the video \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist entry was successful. The application navigated to the playlist view, displaying \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' as the title and listing \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30\\' as a track within it. This confirms the first video was added to the playlist, completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top-left of the screen. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to navigate back from the current \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist view to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, where all playlists are listed. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon at [85, 60] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen, which lists all available playlists. This action is a step towards being able to navigate to the video files to add the second video to the playlist.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Browse\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is predicted to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, allowing access to the file system to locate the video \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Browse\\' tab at [959, 502] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. This screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\' and \\'SDCARD\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5 by allowing navigation to the video files.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 27: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Internal Memory\\' which is listed under \\'Storages\\'. The bounding box for the \\'Internal Memory\\' folder icon and text is [390, 33, 529, 336]. Tapping in the center of this area will open the internal storage. This action is predicted to navigate into the internal storage, where the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder should be located. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The VLC application is open, and its main interface is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text \\'Playlists\\' is detected with bounding box [952, 638, 967, 763]. Tapping on the center of this text will navigate to the Playlists screen. This action is predicted to display a list of existing playlists, where I can then look for \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Playlists\\' screen now displays the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist, which shows \\'1 tracks\\'. This indicates that the playlist was created and likely contains the first video. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which involves verifying the content of this playlist.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,211],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist entry.

This action is predicted to open the playlist, displaying its contents, which should include the video \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist entry was successful. The application navigated to the playlist view, displaying \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' as the title and listing \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30\\' as a track within it. This confirms the first video was added to the playlist, completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to navigate back from the current \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist view to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, where all playlists are listed. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon at [85, 60] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen, which lists all available playlists. This action is a step towards being able to navigate to the video files to add the second video to the playlist.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar.

The bounding box for the \\'Internal Memory\\' folder icon and text is [390, 33, 529, 336]. Tapping in the center of this area will open the internal storage. This action is predicted to navigate into the internal storage, where the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder should be located. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Internal Memory\\' at [459, 184] was successful. The application navigated from the main \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. This screen lists various folders within the internal storage. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5 by allowing navigation towards the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab located at the bottom of the screen. The text \\'Playlists\\' is detected with bounding box [952, 638, 967, 763]. Tapping on the center of this text will navigate to the Playlists screen. This action is predicted to display a list of existing playlists, where I can then look for \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The \\'Playlists\\' screen now displays the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist, which shows \\'1 tracks\\'. This indicates that the playlist was created and likely contains the first video. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 4, which involves verifying the content of this playlist.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,211],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist entry. The playlist entry is visible on the screen and shows \\'1 tracks\\'. This action is predicted to open the playlist, displaying its contents, which should include the video \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist entry was successful. The application navigated to the playlist view, displaying \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' as the title and listing \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30\\' as a track within it. This confirms the first video was added to the playlist, completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top-left of the screen. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to navigate back from the current \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist view to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, where all playlists are listed. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon at [85, 60] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen, which lists all available playlists. This action is a step towards being able to navigate to the video files to add the second video to the playlist.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Browse\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is predicted to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, allowing access to the file system to locate the video \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Browse\\' tab at [959, 502] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. This screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\' and \\'SDCARD\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5 by allowing navigation to the video files.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Internal Memory\\' which is listed under \\'Storages\\'. The bounding box for the \\'Internal Memory\\' folder icon and text is [390, 33, 529, 336]. Tapping in the center of this area will open the internal storage. This action is predicted to navigate into the internal storage, where the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder should be located. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Internal Memory\\' at [459, 184] was successful. The application navigated from the main \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. This screen lists various folders within the internal storage. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5 by allowing navigation towards the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 28: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500]. This action is predicted to scroll the list of folders downwards, revealing more folders in the \\'Internal memory\\', hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The VLC application is open, and its main interface is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19.

This action is predicted to open the playlist, displaying its contents, which should include the video \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist entry was successful. The application navigated to the playlist view, displaying \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' as the title and listing \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30\\' as a track within it. This confirms the first video was added to the playlist, completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to navigate back from the current \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist view to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, where all playlists are listed. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon at [85, 60] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen, which lists all available playlists. This action is a step towards being able to navigate to the video files to add the second video to the playlist.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Browse\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is predicted to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, allowing access to the file system to locate the video \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Browse\\' tab at [959, 502] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. This screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\' and \\'SDCARD\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5 by allowing navigation to the video files.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Internal Memory\\' which is listed under \\'Storages\\'. The bounding box for the \\'Internal Memory\\' folder icon and text is [390, 33, 529, 336]. Tapping in the center of this area will open the internal storage. This action is predicted to navigate into the internal storage, where the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder should be located. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Internal Memory\\' at [459, 184] was successful. The application navigated from the main \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. This screen lists various folders within the internal storage. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5 by allowing navigation towards the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500]. This action is predicted to scroll the list of folders downwards, revealing more folders in the \\'Internal memory\\', hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders downwards within the \\'Internal memory\\' view. As a result, the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which was previously not visible, is now displayed on the screen. This action was successful and directly contributes to the progress of Subgoal 5.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,211],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist entry. The playlist entry is visible on the screen and shows \\'1 tracks\\'. This action is predicted to open the playlist, displaying its contents, which should include the video \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist entry was successful. The application navigated to the playlist view, displaying \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' as the title and listing \\'highlight_41_4K_2023_03_30\\' as a track within it. This confirms the first video was added to the playlist, completing Subgoal 4.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top-left of the screen. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to navigate back from the current \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist view to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, where all playlists are listed. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon at [85, 60] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen, which lists all available playlists. This action is a step towards being able to navigate to the video files to add the second video to the playlist.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Browse\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is predicted to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, allowing access to the file system to locate the video \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Browse\\' tab at [959, 502] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. This screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\' and \\'SDCARD\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5 by allowing navigation to the video files.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Internal Memory\\' which is listed under \\'Storages\\'. The bounding box for the \\'Internal Memory\\' folder icon and text is [390, 33, 529, 336]. Tapping in the center of this area will open the internal storage. This action is predicted to navigate into the internal storage, where the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder should be located. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Internal Memory\\' at [459, 184] was successful. The application navigated from the main \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. This screen lists various folders within the internal storage. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5 by allowing navigation towards the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500]. This action is predicted to scroll the list of folders downwards, revealing more folders in the \\'Internal memory\\', hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders downwards within the \\'Internal memory\\' view. As a result, the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which was previously not visible, is now displayed on the screen. This action was successful and directly contributes to the progress of Subgoal 5.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 29: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is visible at the bottom of the screen. This action is predicted to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, displaying its contents, which should include the video file \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The VLC application is open, and its main interface is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon at [85, 60] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen, which lists all available playlists. This action is a step towards being able to navigate to the video files to add the second video to the playlist.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Browse\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is predicted to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, allowing access to the file system to locate the video \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Browse\\' tab at [959, 502] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. This screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\' and \\'SDCARD\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5 by allowing navigation to the video files.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Internal Memory\\' which is listed under \\'Storages\\'. The bounding box for the \\'Internal Memory\\' folder icon and text is [390, 33, 529, 336]. Tapping in the center of this area will open the internal storage. This action is predicted to navigate into the internal storage, where the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder should be located. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Internal Memory\\' at [459, 184] was successful. The application navigated from the main \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. This screen lists various folders within the internal storage. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5 by allowing navigation towards the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500]. This action is predicted to scroll the list of folders downwards, revealing more folders in the \\'Internal memory\\', hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders downwards within the \\'Internal memory\\' view. As a result, the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which was previously not visible, is now displayed on the screen. This action was successful and directly contributes to the progress of Subgoal 5.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is visible at the bottom of the screen. This action is predicted to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, displaying its contents, which should include the video file \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder at [930, 270] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Internal memory\\' folder list to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This screen now displays the video files within the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, including \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.52\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 796, 34, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 222], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 173, 97, 428], \\'text\\': \\'VLCVideos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [121, 38, 140, 675], \\'text\\': \\'Browser Internal memory VLCVideos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 32, 177, 120], \\'text\\': \\'{BEIaYmig\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [156, 172, 194, 701], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_05_clip_34_raw.mp4 1:49\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [230, 32, 239, 116], \\'text\\': \\'HeLPrZ4G\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [218, 170, 255, 548], \\'text\\': \\'final_clip_42_4K.mp4 2:04\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [293, 35, 299, 123], \\'text\\': \\'TE7utr2s\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [279, 172, 317, 776], \\'text\\': \\'highlight_41_4K2023_03_30.mp4 1.21\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [353, 32, 362, 137], \\'text\\': \\'hefucbusiZ\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [342, 171, 379, 598], \\'text\\': \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4 1:15\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [895, 817, 957, 968]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [333, 27, 387, 151]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 787, 101, 881]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [70, 139, 100, 443]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 667, 100, 755]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 250, 37, 295]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 905, 101, 987]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 37, 237]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 145, 37, 184]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [11, 794, 40, 950]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top-left of the screen. This icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to navigate back from the current \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist view to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, where all playlists are listed. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the back arrow icon at [85, 60] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen, which lists all available playlists. This action is a step towards being able to navigate to the video files to add the second video to the playlist.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Browse\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is predicted to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, allowing access to the file system to locate the video \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Browse\\' tab at [959, 502] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. This screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\' and \\'SDCARD\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5 by allowing navigation to the video files.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Internal Memory\\' which is listed under \\'Storages\\'. The bounding box for the \\'Internal Memory\\' folder icon and text is [390, 33, 529, 336]. Tapping in the center of this area will open the internal storage. This action is predicted to navigate into the internal storage, where the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder should be located. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Internal Memory\\' at [459, 184] was successful. The application navigated from the main \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. This screen lists various folders within the internal storage. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5 by allowing navigation towards the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500]. This action is predicted to scroll the list of folders downwards, revealing more folders in the \\'Internal memory\\', hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders downwards within the \\'Internal memory\\' view. As a result, the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which was previously not visible, is now displayed on the screen. This action was successful and directly contributes to the progress of Subgoal 5.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is visible at the bottom of the screen. This action is predicted to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, displaying its contents, which should include the video file \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder at [930, 270] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Internal memory\\' folder list to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This screen now displays the video files within the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, including \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 30: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[361,385],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. The file is currently visible in the list. This action is predicted to select the file and display a contextual menu or bar with options to interact with the selected file, such as \\'Add to playlist\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The VLC application is open, and its main interface is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

The \\'Browse\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is predicted to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, allowing access to the file system to locate the video \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Browse\\' tab at [959, 502] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. This screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\' and \\'SDCARD\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5 by allowing navigation to the video files.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Internal Memory\\' which is listed under \\'Storages\\'. The bounding box for the \\'Internal Memory\\' folder icon and text is [390, 33, 529, 336]. Tapping in the center of this area will open the internal storage. This action is predicted to navigate into the internal storage, where the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder should be located. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Internal Memory\\' at [459, 184] was successful. The application navigated from the main \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. This screen lists various folders within the internal storage. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5 by allowing navigation towards the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500]. This action is predicted to scroll the list of folders downwards, revealing more folders in the \\'Internal memory\\', hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders downwards within the \\'Internal memory\\' view. As a result, the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which was previously not visible, is now displayed on the screen. This action was successful and directly contributes to the progress of Subgoal 5.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is visible at the bottom of the screen. This action is predicted to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, displaying its contents, which should include the video file \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder at [930, 270] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Internal memory\\' folder list to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This screen now displays the video files within the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, including \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[361,385],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. The file is currently visible in the list. This action is predicted to select the file and display a contextual menu or bar with options to interact with the selected file, such as \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The long-press on \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by its highlighted background. A new contextual top bar appeared, displaying \\'1 selected\\' and icons for further actions, including a three-dot menu. This outcome directly facilitates the next step of adding the file to the playlist and brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.52\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 796, 34, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [73, 211, 97, 406], \\'text\\': \\'selected\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [120, 38, 140, 675], \\'text\\': \\'Browser Internal memory VLCVideos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [168, 32, 178, 120], \\'text\\': \\'meeheymh\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [156, 172, 194, 701], \\'text\\': \\'2023_08_05_clip_34_raw.mp4 1:49\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [230, 32, 239, 116], \\'text\\': \\'HeLPrZ4G\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [218, 170, 255, 548], \\'text\\': \\'final_clip_42_4K.mp4 2:04\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [292, 33, 299, 123], \\'text\\': \\'TiFMtr2s\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [278, 172, 317, 776], \\'text\\': \\'highlight_41_4K2023_03_30.mp4 1.21\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [353, 32, 362, 137], \\'text\\': \\'hefucbusiZ\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [342, 170, 379, 598], \\'text\\': \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4 1:15\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [330, 5, 393, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 480, 102, 561]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 249, 36, 295]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 144, 35, 185]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 196, 36, 237]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 144, 103, 429]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [62, 596, 106, 709]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab in the bottom navigation bar. The \\'Browse\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is predicted to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, allowing access to the file system to locate the video \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Browse\\' tab at [959, 502] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. This screen displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\' and \\'SDCARD\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5 by allowing navigation to the video files.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Internal Memory\\' which is listed under \\'Storages\\'. The bounding box for the \\'Internal Memory\\' folder icon and text is [390, 33, 529, 336]. Tapping in the center of this area will open the internal storage. This action is predicted to navigate into the internal storage, where the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder should be located. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Internal Memory\\' at [459, 184] was successful. The application navigated from the main \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. This screen lists various folders within the internal storage. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5 by allowing navigation towards the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500]. This action is predicted to scroll the list of folders downwards, revealing more folders in the \\'Internal memory\\', hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders downwards within the \\'Internal memory\\' view. As a result, the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which was previously not visible, is now displayed on the screen. This action was successful and directly contributes to the progress of Subgoal 5.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is visible at the bottom of the screen. This action is predicted to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, displaying its contents, which should include the video file \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder at [930, 270] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Internal memory\\' folder list to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This screen now displays the video files within the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, including \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[361,385],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. The file is currently visible in the list. This action is predicted to select the file and display a contextual menu or bar with options to interact with the selected file, such as \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The long-press on \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by its highlighted background. A new contextual top bar appeared, displaying \\'1 selected\\' and icons for further actions, including a three-dot menu. This outcome directly facilitates the next step of adding the file to the playlist and brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 31: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,925],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located in the top right of the contextual bar. The icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a pop-up menu with options related to the selected file, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The VLC application is open, and its main interface is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The bounding box for the \\'Internal Memory\\' folder icon and text is [390, 33, 529, 336]. Tapping in the center of this area will open the internal storage. This action is predicted to navigate into the internal storage, where the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder should be located. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Internal Memory\\' at [459, 184] was successful. The application navigated from the main \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. This screen lists various folders within the internal storage. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5 by allowing navigation towards the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500]. This action is predicted to scroll the list of folders downwards, revealing more folders in the \\'Internal memory\\', hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders downwards within the \\'Internal memory\\' view. As a result, the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which was previously not visible, is now displayed on the screen. This action was successful and directly contributes to the progress of Subgoal 5.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is visible at the bottom of the screen. This action is predicted to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, displaying its contents, which should include the video file \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder at [930, 270] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Internal memory\\' folder list to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This screen now displays the video files within the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, including \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[361,385],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. The file is currently visible in the list. This action is predicted to select the file and display a contextual menu or bar with options to interact with the selected file, such as \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The long-press on \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by its highlighted background. A new contextual top bar appeared, displaying \\'1 selected\\' and icons for further actions, including a three-dot menu. This outcome directly facilitates the next step of adding the file to the playlist and brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,925],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located in the top right of the contextual bar. The icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a pop-up menu with options related to the selected file, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [85, 925] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen, providing options to \\'Add to new playlist\\' or \\'Add to existing playlist\\'. The existing playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' is listed under \\'Add to existing playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by presenting the necessary options to add the selected video to the target playlist.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Internal Memory\\' which is listed under \\'Storages\\'. The bounding box for the \\'Internal Memory\\' folder icon and text is [390, 33, 529, 336]. Tapping in the center of this area will open the internal storage. This action is predicted to navigate into the internal storage, where the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder should be located. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Internal Memory\\' at [459, 184] was successful. The application navigated from the main \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. This screen lists various folders within the internal storage. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5 by allowing navigation towards the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [700, 500] to [300, 500]. This action is predicted to scroll the list of folders downwards, revealing more folders in the \\'Internal memory\\', hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders downwards within the \\'Internal memory\\' view. As a result, the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which was previously not visible, is now displayed on the screen. This action was successful and directly contributes to the progress of Subgoal 5.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is visible at the bottom of the screen. This action is predicted to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, displaying its contents, which should include the video file \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder at [930, 270] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Internal memory\\' folder list to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This screen now displays the video files within the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, including \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[361,385],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. The file is currently visible in the list. This action is predicted to select the file and display a contextual menu or bar with options to interact with the selected file, such as \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The long-press on \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by its highlighted background. A new contextual top bar appeared, displaying \\'1 selected\\' and icons for further actions, including a three-dot menu. This outcome directly facilitates the next step of adding the file to the playlist and brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,925],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located in the top right of the contextual bar. The icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a pop-up menu with options related to the selected file, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [85, 925] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen, providing options to \\'Add to new playlist\\' or \\'Add to existing playlist\\'. The existing playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' is listed under \\'Add to existing playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by presenting the necessary options to add the selected video to the target playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 32: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[939,351],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist listed under \\'Add to existing playlist\\'. The bounding box for \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' is [919, 171, 959, 531]. This action is predicted to add the selected video (\\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\') to the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist and close the pop-up menu.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [85, 925] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen, providing options to \\'Add to new playlist\\' or \\'Add to existing playlist\\'. The existing playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' is listed under \\'Add to existing playlist\\'.

This action is predicted to add the selected video (\\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\') to the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist and close the pop-up menu. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' at [939, 351] was successful. The pop-up menu for adding to a playlist closed, and the screen returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This action is presumed to have added the selected video (\\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\') to the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.

Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to scroll the list of folders downwards, revealing more folders in the \\'Internal memory\\', hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders downwards within the \\'Internal memory\\' view. As a result, the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which was previously not visible, is now displayed on the screen. This action was successful and directly contributes to the progress of Subgoal 5.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is visible at the bottom of the screen. This action is predicted to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, displaying its contents, which should include the video file \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder at [930, 270] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Internal memory\\' folder list to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This screen now displays the video files within the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, including \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[361,385],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. The file is currently visible in the list. This action is predicted to select the file and display a contextual menu or bar with options to interact with the selected file, such as \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The long-press on \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by its highlighted background.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,270],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is visible at the bottom of the screen. This action is predicted to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, displaying its contents, which should include the video file \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder at [930, 270] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'Internal memory\\' folder list to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This screen now displays the video files within the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, including \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[361,385],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. The file is currently visible in the list. This action is predicted to select the file and display a contextual menu or bar with options to interact with the selected file, such as \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The long-press on \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by its highlighted background. A new contextual top bar appeared, displaying \\'1 selected\\' and icons for further actions, including a three-dot menu. This outcome directly facilitates the next step of adding the file to the playlist and brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,925],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located in the top right of the contextual bar. The icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a pop-up menu with options related to the selected file, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [85, 925] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen, providing options to \\'Add to new playlist\\' or \\'Add to existing playlist\\'. The existing playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' is listed under \\'Add to existing playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by presenting the necessary options to add the selected video to the target playlist.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[939,351],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist listed under \\'Add to existing playlist\\'. The bounding box for \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' is [919, 171, 959, 531]. This action is predicted to add the selected video (\\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\') to the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist and close the pop-up menu. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' at [939, 351] was successful. The pop-up menu for adding to a playlist closed, and the screen returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This action is presumed to have added the selected video (\\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\') to the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon located at the top-left of the screen. The \\'X\\' icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to navigate back from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view to the previous screen, which should be the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view or the main \\'Browse\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon at [85, 60] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view to the main \\'Browse\\' screen. The bottom navigation bar, which includes the \\'Playlists\\' tab, is now visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5 by allowing access to the \\'Playlists\\' section for verification.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 34: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[950,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab located at the bottom of the screen. The \\'Playlists\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is predicted to navigate to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, where the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist should be visible. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The VLC application is open, and its main interface is displayed.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"Successfully swiped up to open the app drawer.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to select the file and display a contextual menu or bar with options to interact with the selected file, such as \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The long-press on \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by its highlighted background. A new contextual top bar appeared, displaying \\'1 selected\\' and icons for further actions, including a three-dot menu. This outcome directly facilitates the next step of adding the file to the playlist and brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,925],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located in the top right of the contextual bar. The icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a pop-up menu with options related to the selected file, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [85, 925] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen, providing options to \\'Add to new playlist\\' or \\'Add to existing playlist\\'. The existing playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' is listed under \\'Add to existing playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by presenting the necessary options to add the selected video to the target playlist.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[939,351],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist listed under \\'Add to existing playlist\\'. The bounding box for \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' is [919, 171, 959, 531]. This action is predicted to add the selected video (\\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\') to the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist and close the pop-up menu. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' at [939, 351] was successful. The pop-up menu for adding to a playlist closed, and the screen returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This action is presumed to have added the selected video (\\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\') to the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon located at the top-left of the screen. The \\'X\\' icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to navigate back from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view to the previous screen, which should be the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view or the main \\'Browse\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon at [85, 60] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view to the main \\'Browse\\' screen. The bottom navigation bar, which includes the \\'Playlists\\' tab, is now visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5 by allowing access to the \\'Playlists\\' section for verification.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab at [950, 700] was successful. The VLC application switched from the \\'Browse\\' view to the \\'Playlists\\' view. The \\'Playlists\\' view now shows the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist, which is listed with \\'2 tracks\\' and a duration of \\'2:36\\'. This action successfully navigated to the correct screen to continue with the playlist verification and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.55\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 796, 35, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 222], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 156, 96, 251], \\'text\\': \\'VLC\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [205, 79, 219, 210], \\'text\\': \\'TE7MtN2S\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [204, 297, 221, 445], \\'text\\': \\'hpeycbUamz\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [302, 78, 319, 228], \\'text\\': \\'hp8ycbuamz\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [303, 296, 317, 428], \\'text\\': \\'IEEKE ZS \\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [380, 45, 417, 377], \\'text\\': \\'Ultimate Fails Ser  2 tracks 2.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 59, 966, 143], \\'text\\': \\'Video\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 259, 966, 345], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 448, 966, 556], \\'text\\': \\'Browse\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [949, 636, 968, 764], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 863, 967, 940], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 604, 990, 802]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 213, 990, 385]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 812, 986, 983]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 5, 993, 196]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [912, 399, 991, 597]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [318, 390, 357, 470]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 250, 37, 296]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 37, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [52, 845, 67, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 143, 37, 186]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 810, 98, 877]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [67, 894, 102, 987]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 697, 97, 755]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [14, 787, 38, 953]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [125, 42, 149, 85]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [385, 401, 421, 474]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[361,385],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\'. The file is currently visible in the list. This action is predicted to select the file and display a contextual menu or bar with options to interact with the selected file, such as \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The long-press on \\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by its highlighted background. A new contextual top bar appeared, displaying \\'1 selected\\' and icons for further actions, including a three-dot menu. This outcome directly facilitates the next step of adding the file to the playlist and brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,925],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located in the top right of the contextual bar. The icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to open a pop-up menu with options related to the selected file, including \\'Add to playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [85, 925] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen, providing options to \\'Add to new playlist\\' or \\'Add to existing playlist\\'. The existing playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' is listed under \\'Add to existing playlist\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by presenting the necessary options to add the selected video to the target playlist.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[939,351],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist listed under \\'Add to existing playlist\\'. The bounding box for \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' is [919, 171, 959, 531]. This action is predicted to add the selected video (\\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\') to the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist and close the pop-up menu. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' at [939, 351] was successful. The pop-up menu for adding to a playlist closed, and the screen returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This action is presumed to have added the selected video (\\'scene_68_4K_copy.mp4\\') to the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist. This brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon located at the top-left of the screen. The \\'X\\' icon is currently visible. This action is predicted to navigate back from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view to the previous screen, which should be the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view or the main \\'Browse\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'X\\' icon at [85, 60] was successful. The application navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view to the main \\'Browse\\' screen. The bottom navigation bar, which includes the \\'Playlists\\' tab, is now visible. This action brings the agent closer to completing Subgoal 5 by allowing access to the \\'Playlists\\' section for verification.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[950,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab located at the bottom of the screen. The \\'Playlists\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is predicted to navigate to the \\'Playlists\\' screen, where the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist should be visible. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab at [950, 700] was successful. The VLC application switched from the \\'Browse\\' view to the \\'Playlists\\' view. The \\'Playlists\\' view now shows the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist, which is listed with \\'2 tracks\\' and a duration of \\'2:36\\'. This action successfully navigated to the correct screen to continue with the playlist verification and brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 35: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,211],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist. The playlist is currently displayed with \\'2 tracks\\'. This action is predicted to open the playlist, showing the videos it contains, allowing for verification of its contents.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
