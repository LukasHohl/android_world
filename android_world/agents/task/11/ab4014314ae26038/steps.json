Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, where the Tasks app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Tasks app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal more apps in the app drawer, hopefully including the Tasks app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer down, revealing more applications. The \\'Tasks\\' app is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Tasks app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 2: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Answer with the title only. If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 3 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [200, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, where the Tasks app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Tasks app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal more apps in the app drawer, hopefully including the Tasks app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer down, revealing more applications. The \\'Tasks\\' app is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Tasks app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[818,389],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon, which is located around [818, 389]. This action is predicted to open the Tasks app, bringing the agent closer to completing the user\\'s instruction. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Tasks\\' app icon at [818, 389] was successful. The Tasks app opened, and the \\'My Tasks\\' screen is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[940,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (around [940, 60]). This action is predicted to open a navigation drawer or menu, which might contain options for navigating to a specific date or opening a calendar view. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the Tasks app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Tasks app is open and the main screen of the app is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened and scrolled.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

This action is predicted to reveal more apps in the app drawer, hopefully including the Tasks app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer down, revealing more applications. The \\'Tasks\\' app is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Tasks app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This action is predicted to open the Tasks app, bringing the agent closer to completing the user\\'s instruction. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Tasks\\' app icon at [818, 389] was successful. The Tasks app opened, and the \\'My Tasks\\' screen is now visible.

This action is predicted to open a navigation drawer or menu, which might contain options for navigating to a specific date or opening a calendar view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [940, 60] was successful. A navigation drawer opened on the left side of the screen, revealing several options. This action brings the agent closer to navigating to the desired date by providing access to different views or functionalities within the app.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

Answer with the title only. If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 4 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [200, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, where the Tasks app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Tasks app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal more apps in the app drawer, hopefully including the Tasks app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer down, revealing more applications. The \\'Tasks\\' app is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Tasks app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[818,389],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon, which is located around [818, 389]. This action is predicted to open the Tasks app, bringing the agent closer to completing the user\\'s instruction. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Tasks\\' app icon at [818, 389] was successful. The Tasks app opened, and the \\'My Tasks\\' screen is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[940,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (around [940, 60]). This action is predicted to open a navigation drawer or menu, which might contain options for navigating to a specific date or opening a calendar view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [940, 60] was successful. A navigation drawer opened on the left side of the screen, revealing several options. This action brings the agent closer to navigating to the desired date by providing access to different views or functionalities within the app.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the navigation drawer, which is located around [457, 200]. This action is predicted to open a calendar view or a view that allows date selection, bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 18, 2023. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the Tasks app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Tasks app is open and the main screen of the app is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened and scrolled.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [200, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, where the Tasks app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Tasks app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal more apps in the app drawer, hopefully including the Tasks app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer down, revealing more applications. The \\'Tasks\\' app is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Tasks app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[818,389],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon, which is located around [818, 389]. This action is predicted to open the Tasks app, bringing the agent closer to completing the user\\'s instruction. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Tasks\\' app icon at [818, 389] was successful. The Tasks app opened, and the \\'My Tasks\\' screen is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[940,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (around [940, 60]). This action is predicted to open a navigation drawer or menu, which might contain options for navigating to a specific date or opening a calendar view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [940, 60] was successful. A navigation drawer opened on the left side of the screen, revealing several options. This action brings the agent closer to navigating to the desired date by providing access to different views or functionalities within the app.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the navigation drawer, which is located around [457, 200]. This action is predicted to open a calendar view or a view that allows date selection, bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 18, 2023. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Today\\' at [457, 200] resulted in an error pop-up: \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\'. This pop-up has two buttons: \\'App info\\' and \\'Close app\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 18, 2023, and was therefore a failure. To recover, the pop-up needs to be closed by tapping \\'Close app\\'. Then, an alternative method for date navigation must be found.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Answer with the title only. If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (from [900, 500] to [200, 500]) to open the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal the app drawer, where the Tasks app can be found. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Tasks app.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal more apps in the app drawer, hopefully including the Tasks app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer down, revealing more applications. The \\'Tasks\\' app is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Tasks app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[818,389],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon, which is located around [818, 389]. This action is predicted to open the Tasks app, bringing the agent closer to completing the user\\'s instruction. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Tasks\\' app icon at [818, 389] was successful. The Tasks app opened, and the \\'My Tasks\\' screen is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[940,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (around [940, 60]). This action is predicted to open a navigation drawer or menu, which might contain options for navigating to a specific date or opening a calendar view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [940, 60] was successful. A navigation drawer opened on the left side of the screen, revealing several options. This action brings the agent closer to navigating to the desired date by providing access to different views or functionalities within the app.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the navigation drawer, which is located around [457, 200]. This action is predicted to open a calendar view or a view that allows date selection, bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 18, 2023. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Today\\' at [457, 200] resulted in an error pop-up: \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\'. This pop-up has two buttons: \\'App info\\' and \\'Close app\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 18, 2023, and was therefore a failure. To recover, the pop-up needs to be closed by tapping \\'Close app\\'. Then, an alternative method for date navigation must be found.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button, located at approximately [580, 345], to dismiss the error pop-up. This is predicted to close the pop-up and allow further interaction with the Tasks app. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the Tasks app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Tasks app is open and the main screen of the app is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened and scrolled.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is predicted to reveal more apps in the app drawer, hopefully including the Tasks app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer down, revealing more applications. The \\'Tasks\\' app is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Tasks app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[818,389],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon, which is located around [818, 389]. This action is predicted to open the Tasks app, bringing the agent closer to completing the user\\'s instruction. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Tasks\\' app icon at [818, 389] was successful. The Tasks app opened, and the \\'My Tasks\\' screen is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[940,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (around [940, 60]). This action is predicted to open a navigation drawer or menu, which might contain options for navigating to a specific date or opening a calendar view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [940, 60] was successful. A navigation drawer opened on the left side of the screen, revealing several options. This action brings the agent closer to navigating to the desired date by providing access to different views or functionalities within the app.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the navigation drawer, which is located around [457, 200]. This action is predicted to open a calendar view or a view that allows date selection, bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 18, 2023. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Today\\' at [457, 200] resulted in an error pop-up: \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\'. This pop-up has two buttons: \\'App info\\' and \\'Close app\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 18, 2023, and was therefore a failure. To recover, the pop-up needs to be closed by tapping \\'Close app\\'. Then, an alternative method for date navigation must be found.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button, located at approximately [580, 345], to dismiss the error pop-up. This is predicted to close the pop-up and allow further interaction with the Tasks app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Close app\\' at [580, 345] was successful. The error pop-up \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\' has been dismissed. The Tasks app is still open, and the navigation drawer on the left side remains visible. This action allows the agent to continue interacting with the app, bringing it closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the specified date.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Answer with the title only. If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the app drawer. This action is predicted to reveal more apps in the app drawer, hopefully including the Tasks app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer down, revealing more applications. The \\'Tasks\\' app is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of opening the Tasks app.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[818,389],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon, which is located around [818, 389]. This action is predicted to open the Tasks app, bringing the agent closer to completing the user\\'s instruction. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Tasks\\' app icon at [818, 389] was successful. The Tasks app opened, and the \\'My Tasks\\' screen is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[940,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (around [940, 60]). This action is predicted to open a navigation drawer or menu, which might contain options for navigating to a specific date or opening a calendar view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [940, 60] was successful. A navigation drawer opened on the left side of the screen, revealing several options. This action brings the agent closer to navigating to the desired date by providing access to different views or functionalities within the app.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the navigation drawer, which is located around [457, 200]. This action is predicted to open a calendar view or a view that allows date selection, bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 18, 2023. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Today\\' at [457, 200] resulted in an error pop-up: \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\'. This pop-up has two buttons: \\'App info\\' and \\'Close app\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 18, 2023, and was therefore a failure. To recover, the pop-up needs to be closed by tapping \\'Close app\\'. Then, an alternative method for date navigation must be found.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button, located at approximately [580, 345], to dismiss the error pop-up. This is predicted to close the pop-up and allow further interaction with the Tasks app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Close app\\' at [580, 345] was successful. The error pop-up \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\' has been dismissed. The Tasks app is still open, and the navigation drawer on the left side remains visible. This action allows the agent to continue interacting with the app, bringing it closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the specified date.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[348,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'My Tasks\\' at [348, 249] in the navigation drawer. This is predicted to close the navigation drawer and return to the main \\'My Tasks\\' screen. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the Tasks app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Tasks app is open and the main screen of the app is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened and scrolled.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[818,389],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon, which is located around [818, 389]. This action is predicted to open the Tasks app, bringing the agent closer to completing the user\\'s instruction. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Tasks\\' app icon at [818, 389] was successful. The Tasks app opened, and the \\'My Tasks\\' screen is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[940,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (around [940, 60]). This action is predicted to open a navigation drawer or menu, which might contain options for navigating to a specific date or opening a calendar view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [940, 60] was successful. A navigation drawer opened on the left side of the screen, revealing several options. This action brings the agent closer to navigating to the desired date by providing access to different views or functionalities within the app.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the navigation drawer, which is located around [457, 200]. This action is predicted to open a calendar view or a view that allows date selection, bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 18, 2023. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Today\\' at [457, 200] resulted in an error pop-up: \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\'. This pop-up has two buttons: \\'App info\\' and \\'Close app\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 18, 2023, and was therefore a failure. To recover, the pop-up needs to be closed by tapping \\'Close app\\'. Then, an alternative method for date navigation must be found.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button, located at approximately [580, 345], to dismiss the error pop-up. This is predicted to close the pop-up and allow further interaction with the Tasks app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Close app\\' at [580, 345] was successful. The error pop-up \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\' has been dismissed. The Tasks app is still open, and the navigation drawer on the left side remains visible. This action allows the agent to continue interacting with the app, bringing it closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the specified date.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[348,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'My Tasks\\' at [348, 249] in the navigation drawer. This is predicted to close the navigation drawer and return to the main \\'My Tasks\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'My Tasks\\' at [348, 249] in the navigation drawer was successful. The navigation drawer closed, and the app returned to the main \\'My Tasks\\' screen. This allows the agent to interact with the main screen elements to find a way to navigate to the specified date, thus bringing it closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Answer with the title only. If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[818,389],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Tasks\\' app icon, which is located around [818, 389]. This action is predicted to open the Tasks app, bringing the agent closer to completing the user\\'s instruction. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Tasks\\' app icon at [818, 389] was successful. The Tasks app opened, and the \\'My Tasks\\' screen is now visible. This completes the first subgoal and brings the agent closer to fulfilling the user\\'s instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[940,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (around [940, 60]). This action is predicted to open a navigation drawer or menu, which might contain options for navigating to a specific date or opening a calendar view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [940, 60] was successful. A navigation drawer opened on the left side of the screen, revealing several options. This action brings the agent closer to navigating to the desired date by providing access to different views or functionalities within the app.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the navigation drawer, which is located around [457, 200]. This action is predicted to open a calendar view or a view that allows date selection, bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 18, 2023. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Today\\' at [457, 200] resulted in an error pop-up: \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\'. This pop-up has two buttons: \\'App info\\' and \\'Close app\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 18, 2023, and was therefore a failure. To recover, the pop-up needs to be closed by tapping \\'Close app\\'. Then, an alternative method for date navigation must be found.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button, located at approximately [580, 345], to dismiss the error pop-up. This is predicted to close the pop-up and allow further interaction with the Tasks app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Close app\\' at [580, 345] was successful. The error pop-up \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\' has been dismissed. The Tasks app is still open, and the navigation drawer on the left side remains visible. This action allows the agent to continue interacting with the app, bringing it closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the specified date.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[348,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'My Tasks\\' at [348, 249] in the navigation drawer. This is predicted to close the navigation drawer and return to the main \\'My Tasks\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'My Tasks\\' at [348, 249] in the navigation drawer was successful. The navigation drawer closed, and the app returned to the main \\'My Tasks\\' screen. This allows the agent to interact with the main screen elements to find a way to navigate to the specified date, thus bringing it closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[943,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the bottom right of the screen, around [943, 946]. This action is predicted to open a menu that might contain options for date navigation or calendar view, which is necessary to complete the current subgoal. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the Tasks app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Tasks app is open and the main screen of the app is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened and scrolled.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[940,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (around [940, 60]). This action is predicted to open a navigation drawer or menu, which might contain options for navigating to a specific date or opening a calendar view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [940, 60] was successful. A navigation drawer opened on the left side of the screen, revealing several options. This action brings the agent closer to navigating to the desired date by providing access to different views or functionalities within the app.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the navigation drawer, which is located around [457, 200]. This action is predicted to open a calendar view or a view that allows date selection, bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 18, 2023. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Today\\' at [457, 200] resulted in an error pop-up: \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\'. This pop-up has two buttons: \\'App info\\' and \\'Close app\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 18, 2023, and was therefore a failure. To recover, the pop-up needs to be closed by tapping \\'Close app\\'. Then, an alternative method for date navigation must be found.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button, located at approximately [580, 345], to dismiss the error pop-up. This is predicted to close the pop-up and allow further interaction with the Tasks app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Close app\\' at [580, 345] was successful. The error pop-up \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\' has been dismissed. The Tasks app is still open, and the navigation drawer on the left side remains visible. This action allows the agent to continue interacting with the app, bringing it closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the specified date.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[348,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'My Tasks\\' at [348, 249] in the navigation drawer. This is predicted to close the navigation drawer and return to the main \\'My Tasks\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'My Tasks\\' at [348, 249] in the navigation drawer was successful. The navigation drawer closed, and the app returned to the main \\'My Tasks\\' screen. This allows the agent to interact with the main screen elements to find a way to navigate to the specified date, thus bringing it closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[943,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the bottom right of the screen, around [943, 946]. This action is predicted to open a menu that might contain options for date navigation or calendar view, which is necessary to complete the current subgoal. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [943, 946] was successful in opening a menu. The menu appeared in the bottom right quadrant of the screen and contains the options: \"Clear Completed\", \"Collapse subtasks\", \"Expand subtasks\", \"Show completed\", \"Show unstarted\", and \"Share\". This menu does not offer any date navigation capabilities. Thus, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 18, 2023. The menu needs to be closed before proceeding.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Answer with the title only. If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[940,60],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the hamburger menu icon located at the bottom left of the screen (around [940, 60]). This action is predicted to open a navigation drawer or menu, which might contain options for navigating to a specific date or opening a calendar view. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the hamburger menu icon at [940, 60] was successful. A navigation drawer opened on the left side of the screen, revealing several options. This action brings the agent closer to navigating to the desired date by providing access to different views or functionalities within the app.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the navigation drawer, which is located around [457, 200]. This action is predicted to open a calendar view or a view that allows date selection, bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 18, 2023. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Today\\' at [457, 200] resulted in an error pop-up: \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\'. This pop-up has two buttons: \\'App info\\' and \\'Close app\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 18, 2023, and was therefore a failure. To recover, the pop-up needs to be closed by tapping \\'Close app\\'. Then, an alternative method for date navigation must be found.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button, located at approximately [580, 345], to dismiss the error pop-up. This is predicted to close the pop-up and allow further interaction with the Tasks app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Close app\\' at [580, 345] was successful. The error pop-up \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\' has been dismissed. The Tasks app is still open, and the navigation drawer on the left side remains visible. This action allows the agent to continue interacting with the app, bringing it closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the specified date.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[348,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'My Tasks\\' at [348, 249] in the navigation drawer. This is predicted to close the navigation drawer and return to the main \\'My Tasks\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'My Tasks\\' at [348, 249] in the navigation drawer was successful. The navigation drawer closed, and the app returned to the main \\'My Tasks\\' screen. This allows the agent to interact with the main screen elements to find a way to navigate to the specified date, thus bringing it closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[943,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the bottom right of the screen, around [943, 946]. This action is predicted to open a menu that might contain options for date navigation or calendar view, which is necessary to complete the current subgoal. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [943, 946] was successful in opening a menu. The menu appeared in the bottom right quadrant of the screen and contains the options: \"Clear Completed\", \"Collapse subtasks\", \"Expand subtasks\", \"Show completed\", \"Show unstarted\", and \"Share\". This menu does not offer any date navigation capabilities. Thus, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 18, 2023. The menu needs to be closed before proceeding.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close the currently open menu. This menu was opened by tapping the three-dot icon and contains options like \\'Clear Completed\\', \\'Collapse subtasks\\', etc. Closing this menu will allow interaction with other elements on the screen, such as the search icon, to find a way to navigate to the desired date. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the Tasks app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Tasks app is open and the main screen of the app is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened and scrolled.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders.

Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the navigation drawer, which is located around [457, 200]. This action is predicted to open a calendar view or a view that allows date selection, bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 18, 2023. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Today\\' at [457, 200] resulted in an error pop-up: \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\'. This pop-up has two buttons: \\'App info\\' and \\'Close app\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 18, 2023, and was therefore a failure. To recover, the pop-up needs to be closed by tapping \\'Close app\\'. Then, an alternative method for date navigation must be found.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button, located at approximately [580, 345], to dismiss the error pop-up. This is predicted to close the pop-up and allow further interaction with the Tasks app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Close app\\' at [580, 345] was successful. The error pop-up \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\' has been dismissed. The Tasks app is still open, and the navigation drawer on the left side remains visible. This action allows the agent to continue interacting with the app, bringing it closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the specified date.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[348,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'My Tasks\\' at [348, 249] in the navigation drawer. This is predicted to close the navigation drawer and return to the main \\'My Tasks\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'My Tasks\\' at [348, 249] in the navigation drawer was successful. The navigation drawer closed, and the app returned to the main \\'My Tasks\\' screen. This allows the agent to interact with the main screen elements to find a way to navigate to the specified date, thus bringing it closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[943,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the bottom right of the screen, around [943, 946]. This action is predicted to open a menu that might contain options for date navigation or calendar view, which is necessary to complete the current subgoal. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [943, 946] was successful in opening a menu. The menu appeared in the bottom right quadrant of the screen and contains the options: \"Clear Completed\", \"Collapse subtasks\", \"Expand subtasks\", \"Show completed\", \"Show unstarted\", and \"Share\". This menu does not offer any date navigation capabilities. Thus, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 18, 2023. The menu needs to be closed before proceeding.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close the currently open menu. This menu was opened by tapping the three-dot icon and contains options like \\'Clear Completed\\', \\'Collapse subtasks\\', etc. Closing this menu will allow interaction with other elements on the screen, such as the search icon, to find a way to navigate to the desired date. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) was successful. The menu that was previously open in the bottom right corner of the screen is now closed. This allows the agent to interact with other elements on the \\'My Tasks\\' screen. The action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the next planned step, which is to explore the search functionality for date navigation.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Answer with the title only. If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[457,200],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Today\\' option in the navigation drawer, which is located around [457, 200]. This action is predicted to open a calendar view or a view that allows date selection, bringing the agent closer to navigating to October 18, 2023. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Today\\' at [457, 200] resulted in an error pop-up: \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\'. This pop-up has two buttons: \\'App info\\' and \\'Close app\\'. The action did not bring the agent closer to navigating to October 18, 2023, and was therefore a failure. To recover, the pop-up needs to be closed by tapping \\'Close app\\'. Then, an alternative method for date navigation must be found.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button, located at approximately [580, 345], to dismiss the error pop-up. This is predicted to close the pop-up and allow further interaction with the Tasks app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Close app\\' at [580, 345] was successful. The error pop-up \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\' has been dismissed. The Tasks app is still open, and the navigation drawer on the left side remains visible. This action allows the agent to continue interacting with the app, bringing it closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the specified date.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[348,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'My Tasks\\' at [348, 249] in the navigation drawer. This is predicted to close the navigation drawer and return to the main \\'My Tasks\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'My Tasks\\' at [348, 249] in the navigation drawer was successful. The navigation drawer closed, and the app returned to the main \\'My Tasks\\' screen. This allows the agent to interact with the main screen elements to find a way to navigate to the specified date, thus bringing it closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[943,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the bottom right of the screen, around [943, 946]. This action is predicted to open a menu that might contain options for date navigation or calendar view, which is necessary to complete the current subgoal. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [943, 946] was successful in opening a menu. The menu appeared in the bottom right quadrant of the screen and contains the options: \"Clear Completed\", \"Collapse subtasks\", \"Expand subtasks\", \"Show completed\", \"Show unstarted\", and \"Share\". This menu does not offer any date navigation capabilities. Thus, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 18, 2023. The menu needs to be closed before proceeding.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close the currently open menu. This menu was opened by tapping the three-dot icon and contains options like \\'Clear Completed\\', \\'Collapse subtasks\\', etc. Closing this menu will allow interaction with other elements on the screen, such as the search icon, to find a way to navigate to the desired date. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) was successful. The menu that was previously open in the bottom right corner of the screen is now closed. This allows the agent to interact with other elements on the \\'My Tasks\\' screen. The action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the next planned step, which is to explore the search functionality for date navigation.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,942],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top right of the screen, around [84, 942]. This action is predicted to open a search interface, which might allow searching for tasks by date or provide access to a calendar view, helping to navigate to October 18, 2023. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open the Tasks app\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"The Tasks app is open and the main screen of the app is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"The app drawer was opened and scrolled.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button, located at approximately [580, 345], to dismiss the error pop-up. This is predicted to close the pop-up and allow further interaction with the Tasks app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Close app\\' at [580, 345] was successful. The error pop-up \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\' has been dismissed. The Tasks app is still open, and the navigation drawer on the left side remains visible. This action allows the agent to continue interacting with the app, bringing it closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the specified date.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[348,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'My Tasks\\' at [348, 249] in the navigation drawer. This is predicted to close the navigation drawer and return to the main \\'My Tasks\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'My Tasks\\' at [348, 249] in the navigation drawer was successful. The navigation drawer closed, and the app returned to the main \\'My Tasks\\' screen. This allows the agent to interact with the main screen elements to find a way to navigate to the specified date, thus bringing it closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[943,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the bottom right of the screen, around [943, 946]. This action is predicted to open a menu that might contain options for date navigation or calendar view, which is necessary to complete the current subgoal. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [943, 946] was successful in opening a menu. The menu appeared in the bottom right quadrant of the screen and contains the options: \"Clear Completed\", \"Collapse subtasks\", \"Expand subtasks\", \"Show completed\", \"Show unstarted\", and \"Share\". This menu does not offer any date navigation capabilities. Thus, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 18, 2023. The menu needs to be closed before proceeding.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close the currently open menu. This menu was opened by tapping the three-dot icon and contains options like \\'Clear Completed\\', \\'Collapse subtasks\\', etc. Closing this menu will allow interaction with other elements on the screen, such as the search icon, to find a way to navigate to the desired date. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) was successful. The menu that was previously open in the bottom right corner of the screen is now closed. This allows the agent to interact with other elements on the \\'My Tasks\\' screen. The action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the next planned step, which is to explore the search functionality for date navigation.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,942],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top right of the screen, around [84, 942]. This action is predicted to open a search interface, which might allow searching for tasks by date or provide access to a calendar view, helping to navigate to October 18, 2023. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the search icon at [84, 942] was successful. It opened a search interface, with a search bar appearing at the top of the screen and the virtual keyboard becoming visible. The text field with resource-id \\'org.tasks:id/search_src_text\\' is currently focused. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing a potential way to filter tasks by date.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps.

To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Answer with the title only. If there are multiples titles, format your answer in a comma separated list.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[580,345],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Close app\\' button, located at approximately [580, 345], to dismiss the error pop-up. This is predicted to close the pop-up and allow further interaction with the Tasks app. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'Close app\\' at [580, 345] was successful. The error pop-up \\'com.google.androidenv.accessibilityforwarder keeps stopping\\' has been dismissed. The Tasks app is still open, and the navigation drawer on the left side remains visible. This action allows the agent to continue interacting with the app, bringing it closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to the specified date.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[348,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'My Tasks\\' at [348, 249] in the navigation drawer. This is predicted to close the navigation drawer and return to the main \\'My Tasks\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'My Tasks\\' at [348, 249] in the navigation drawer was successful. The navigation drawer closed, and the app returned to the main \\'My Tasks\\' screen. This allows the agent to interact with the main screen elements to find a way to navigate to the specified date, thus bringing it closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[943,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the bottom right of the screen, around [943, 946]. This action is predicted to open a menu that might contain options for date navigation or calendar view, which is necessary to complete the current subgoal. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [943, 946] was successful in opening a menu. The menu appeared in the bottom right quadrant of the screen and contains the options: \"Clear Completed\", \"Collapse subtasks\", \"Expand subtasks\", \"Show completed\", \"Show unstarted\", and \"Share\". This menu does not offer any date navigation capabilities. Thus, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 18, 2023. The menu needs to be closed before proceeding.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close the currently open menu. This menu was opened by tapping the three-dot icon and contains options like \\'Clear Completed\\', \\'Collapse subtasks\\', etc. Closing this menu will allow interaction with other elements on the screen, such as the search icon, to find a way to navigate to the desired date. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) was successful. The menu that was previously open in the bottom right corner of the screen is now closed. This allows the agent to interact with other elements on the \\'My Tasks\\' screen. The action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the next planned step, which is to explore the search functionality for date navigation.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,942],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top right of the screen, around [84, 942]. This action is predicted to open a search interface, which might allow searching for tasks by date or provide access to a calendar view, helping to navigate to October 18, 2023. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the search icon at [84, 942] was successful. It opened a search interface, with a search bar appearing at the top of the screen and the virtual keyboard becoming visible. The text field with resource-id \\'org.tasks:id/search_src_text\\' is currently focused. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing a potential way to filter tasks by date.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"October 18 2023\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'October 18 2023\\' into the search bar (resource-id \\'org.tasks:id/search_src_text\\') which currently contains \\'   \\'. The \\'\\\\n\\' at the end will trigger the search. This is predicted to filter the tasks to show only those matching the entered date.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[348,249],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'My Tasks\\' at [348, 249] in the navigation drawer. This is predicted to close the navigation drawer and return to the main \\'My Tasks\\' screen. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping \\'My Tasks\\' at [348, 249] in the navigation drawer was successful. The navigation drawer closed, and the app returned to the main \\'My Tasks\\' screen. This allows the agent to interact with the main screen elements to find a way to navigate to the specified date, thus bringing it closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[943,946],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the bottom right of the screen, around [943, 946]. This action is predicted to open a menu that might contain options for date navigation or calendar view, which is necessary to complete the current subgoal. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at [943, 946] was successful in opening a menu. The menu appeared in the bottom right quadrant of the screen and contains the options: \"Clear Completed\", \"Collapse subtasks\", \"Expand subtasks\", \"Show completed\", \"Show unstarted\", and \"Share\". This menu does not offer any date navigation capabilities. Thus, the action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of navigating to October 18, 2023. The menu needs to be closed before proceeding.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to close the currently open menu. This menu was opened by tapping the three-dot icon and contains options like \\'Clear Completed\\', \\'Collapse subtasks\\', etc. Closing this menu will allow interaction with other elements on the screen, such as the search icon, to find a way to navigate to the desired date. Actual Outcome: The action of pressing the back button (KEYCODE_BACK) was successful. The menu that was previously open in the bottom right corner of the screen is now closed. This allows the agent to interact with other elements on the \\'My Tasks\\' screen. The action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by enabling the next planned step, which is to explore the search functionality for date navigation.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,942],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the search icon (magnifying glass) located at the top right of the screen, around [84, 942]. This action is predicted to open a search interface, which might allow searching for tasks by date or provide access to a calendar view, helping to navigate to October 18, 2023. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the search icon at [84, 942] was successful. It opened a search interface, with a search bar appearing at the top of the screen and the virtual keyboard becoming visible. The text field with resource-id \\'org.tasks:id/search_src_text\\' is currently focused. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by providing a potential way to filter tasks by date.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"October 18 2023\\\\n\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input \\'October 18 2023\\' into the search bar (resource-id \\'org.tasks:id/search_src_text\\') which currently contains \\'   \\'. The \\'\\\\n\\' at the end will trigger the search. This is predicted to filter the tasks to show only those matching the entered date. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'October 18 2023\\\\n\\' into the search bar was successful. The app performed the search and displayed the results for \\'October 18 2023\\'. The screen shows \"There are no tasks here.\", indicating that no tasks are scheduled for this date. This action successfully navigated to the specified date (by filtering), thus completing Subgoal 2. It also implies Subgoal 3 is complete as there are no tasks to filter. The agent is now ready to proceed with Subgoal 4 to provide the answer.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.39\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \\'{\\\\\\'box_2d\\\\\\': [71, 36, 102, 663], \\\\\\'text\\\\\\': \"Matching \\\\\\'October 18 2023\\\\\\'\"}\\', \"{\\'box_2d\\': [656, 236, 679, 765], \\'text\\': \\'There are no tasks here.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [929, 709, 957, 958], \\'text\\': \\'4 = :\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [882, 425, 948, 576]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 250, 37, 294]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 196, 37, 237]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [921, 678, 968, 773]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 143, 36, 185]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [925, 800, 963, 884]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 822, 43, 945]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [924, 900, 966, 989]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [68, 906, 102, 979]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11.

The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.
