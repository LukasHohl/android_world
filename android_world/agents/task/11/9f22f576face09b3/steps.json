Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [20, 44, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.34\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 796, 34, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [54, 712, 65, 797], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [123, 46, 147, 306], \\'text\\': \\'Sun; Oct 15\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 336, 722, 431], \\'text\\': \\'Gmail\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [705, 561, 722, 676], \\'text\\': \\'Photos\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [704, 781, 722, 921], \\'text\\': \\'YouTube\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [784, 546, 854, 691], \\'text\\': \\'9\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 72, 855, 233]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 299, 856, 464]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [788, 766, 856, 929]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [789, 535, 857, 705]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [628, 536, 729, 694]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 764, 728, 927]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [627, 299, 731, 463]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [900, 701, 948, 795]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 251, 37, 295]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 196, 36, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [893, 802, 952, 921]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 115, 37, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 792, 38, 946]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 2 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom half of the screen (e.g., starting swipe at y=900, x=500 and ending at y=300, x=500) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where I can then search for the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the VLC app. The VLC app is not immediately visible on the current screen of the app drawer.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle-bottom of the screen (e.g., starting swipe at y=700, x=500 and ending at y=300, x=500) to scroll down the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal more apps in the app drawer, hopefully including the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. The VLC app icon is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 2: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where I can then search for the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the VLC app. The VLC app is not immediately visible on the current screen of the app drawer.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle-bottom of the screen (e.g., starting swipe at y=700, x=500 and ending at y=300, x=500) to scroll down the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal more apps in the app drawer, hopefully including the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. The VLC app icon is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[837,840],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the VLC app icon, which is an orange traffic cone icon with the text \\'VLC\\' below it, located in the bottom right of the screen. This action is expected to open the VLC application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the VLC app icon was successful. The VLC application opened, and it is currently displaying the \\'Playlists\\' section, as indicated by the highlighted \\'Playlists\\' tab at the bottom of the screen. The screen shows a message \\'No media files found...\\'. This action successfully completed the active subgoal \\'Open VLC App\\' and has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 796, 35, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 222], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 156, 96, 251], \\'text\\': \\'VLC\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [522, 67, 565, 935], \\'text\\': \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [608, 164, 624, 839], \\'text\\': \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 59, 966, 143], \\'text\\': \\'Video\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 259, 966, 345], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 448, 966, 556], \\'text\\': \\'Browse\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 638, 967, 763], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 863, 967, 940], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [596, 114, 639, 886]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 604, 989, 803]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 810, 986, 985]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 213, 990, 387]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 399, 990, 595]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 7, 993, 196]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [52, 847, 67, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 250, 37, 295]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 812, 98, 876]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 892, 98, 981]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 37, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 143, 37, 186]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 130, 102, 255]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 696, 98, 758]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 788, 38, 949]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 3 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom half of the screen (e.g., starting swipe at y=900, x=500 and ending at y=300, x=500) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where I can then search for the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the VLC app. The VLC app is not immediately visible on the current screen of the app drawer.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle-bottom of the screen (e.g., starting swipe at y=700, x=500 and ending at y=300, x=500) to scroll down the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal more apps in the app drawer, hopefully including the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. The VLC app icon is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[837,840],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the VLC app icon, which is an orange traffic cone icon with the text \\'VLC\\' below it, located in the bottom right of the screen. This action is expected to open the VLC application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the VLC app icon was successful. The VLC application opened, and it is currently displaying the \\'Playlists\\' section, as indicated by the highlighted \\'Playlists\\' tab at the bottom of the screen. The screen shows a message \\'No media files found...\\'. This action successfully completed the active subgoal \\'Open VLC App\\' and has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 3: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,936],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen. The icon is represented by three vertical dots. This action is expected to open a menu containing options, hopefully including an option to create a new playlist. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"VLC app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"App drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"},{\"VariableName\":\"AdventureMarathonPlaylistStatus\",\"Content\":\"\",\"Status\":\"This piece of information is sought. No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"},{\"VariableName\":\"AdventureMarathonPlaylistStatus\",\"Content\":\"\",\"Status\":\"This piece of information is sought. No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 4 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom half of the screen (e.g., starting swipe at y=900, x=500 and ending at y=300, x=500) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where I can then search for the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the VLC app. The VLC app is not immediately visible on the current screen of the app drawer.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle-bottom of the screen (e.g., starting swipe at y=700, x=500 and ending at y=300, x=500) to scroll down the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal more apps in the app drawer, hopefully including the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. The VLC app icon is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[837,840],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the VLC app icon, which is an orange traffic cone icon with the text \\'VLC\\' below it, located in the bottom right of the screen. This action is expected to open the VLC application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the VLC app icon was successful. The VLC application opened, and it is currently displaying the \\'Playlists\\' section, as indicated by the highlighted \\'Playlists\\' tab at the bottom of the screen. The screen shows a message \\'No media files found...\\'. This action successfully completed the active subgoal \\'Open VLC App\\' and has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,936],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen. The icon is represented by three vertical dots. This action is expected to open a menu containing options, hopefully including an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at the top right successfully opened a small pop-up menu. This menu contains two options: \"Display in list\" and \"Refresh\". Neither of these options allows for the creation of a new playlist. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly (the menu appeared), it did not bring the agent closer to creating a new playlist as intended. A different approach is needed to find the playlist creation feature.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.36\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 796, 34, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 222], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 156, 96, 251], \\'text\\': \\'VLC\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [83, 547, 108, 791], \\'text\\': \\'Display in list\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [137, 551, 154, 691], \\'text\\': \\'Refresh\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [522, 67, 565, 935], \\'text\\': \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [608, 164, 624, 839], \\'text\\': \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 59, 966, 143], \\'text\\': \\'Video\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 259, 966, 345], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 448, 966, 556], \\'text\\': \\'Browse\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 638, 967, 763], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 863, 967, 940], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 811, 985, 983]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 603, 987, 805]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [596, 114, 639, 887]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 212, 991, 388]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 400, 989, 594]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 246, 37, 297]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 6, 992, 197]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 193, 37, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 108, 37, 187]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 511, 121, 987]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 4 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom half of the screen (e.g., starting swipe at y=900, x=500 and ending at y=300, x=500) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where I can then search for the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the VLC app. The VLC app is not immediately visible on the current screen of the app drawer.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle-bottom of the screen (e.g., starting swipe at y=700, x=500 and ending at y=300, x=500) to scroll down the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal more apps in the app drawer, hopefully including the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. The VLC app icon is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[837,840],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the VLC app icon, which is an orange traffic cone icon with the text \\'VLC\\' below it, located in the bottom right of the screen. This action is expected to open the VLC application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the VLC app icon was successful. The VLC application opened, and it is currently displaying the \\'Playlists\\' section, as indicated by the highlighted \\'Playlists\\' tab at the bottom of the screen. The screen shows a message \\'No media files found...\\'. This action successfully completed the active subgoal \\'Open VLC App\\' and has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,936],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen. The icon is represented by three vertical dots. This action is expected to open a menu containing options, hopefully including an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at the top right successfully opened a small pop-up menu. This menu contains two options: \"Display in list\" and \"Refresh\". Neither of these options allows for the creation of a new playlist. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly (the menu appeared), it did not bring the agent closer to creating a new playlist as intended. A different approach is needed to find the playlist creation feature.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 4: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' tab located at the bottom right of the screen. The \\'More\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be available. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"VLC app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"App drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where I can then search for the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the VLC app. The VLC app is not immediately visible on the current screen of the app drawer.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle-bottom of the screen (e.g., starting swipe at y=700, x=500 and ending at y=300, x=500) to scroll down the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal more apps in the app drawer, hopefully including the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. The VLC app icon is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[837,840],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the VLC app icon, which is an orange traffic cone icon with the text \\'VLC\\' below it, located in the bottom right of the screen. This action is expected to open the VLC application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the VLC app icon was successful. The VLC application opened, and it is currently displaying the \\'Playlists\\' section, as indicated by the highlighted \\'Playlists\\' tab at the bottom of the screen. The screen shows a message \\'No media files found...\\'. This action successfully completed the active subgoal \\'Open VLC App\\' and has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,936],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen. The icon is represented by three vertical dots. This action is expected to open a menu containing options, hopefully including an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at the top right successfully opened a small pop-up menu. This menu contains two options: \"Display in list\" and \"Refresh\". Neither of these options allows for the creation of a new playlist. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly (the menu appeared), it did not bring the agent closer to creating a new playlist as intended. A different approach is needed to find the playlist creation feature.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' tab located at the bottom right of the screen. The \\'More\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be available. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'More\\' tab at coordinates [959, 901] resulted in the closure of the previously open pop-up menu. The application did not navigate to the \\'More\\' section; the \\'Playlists\\' tab remains the active view. This action did not bring the agent closer to creating a new playlist because the intended navigation to the \\'More\\' section failed. The most probable reason for this failure is that the tap was interpreted as an action to dismiss the pop-up menu rather than an interaction with the \\'More\\' tab itself. To proceed, the \\'More\\' tab needs to be tapped again.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [21, 46, 35, 136], \\'text\\': \\'15.37\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 796, 34, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 222], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 156, 96, 251], \\'text\\': \\'VLC\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [522, 67, 565, 935], \\'text\\': \\'No media files found, please transfer some files to your device or adjust your preferences.\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [608, 164, 624, 839], \\'text\\': \\'GO TO MEDIALIBRARY PREFERENCES\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 59, 966, 143], \\'text\\': \\'Video\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 259, 966, 345], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 448, 966, 556], \\'text\\': \\'Browse\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 638, 967, 763], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 863, 966, 939], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [596, 114, 639, 886]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 811, 985, 983]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 603, 987, 804]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 212, 990, 388]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 400, 990, 595]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 6, 992, 196]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [52, 847, 67, 1000]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 250, 37, 295]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 812, 98, 876]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 893, 98, 980]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 37, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 143, 37, 186]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [71, 696, 98, 758]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [69, 130, 103, 255]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [15, 788, 38, 950]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 0: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[900,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the bottom half of the screen (e.g., starting swipe at y=900, x=500 and ending at y=300, x=500) to open the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal the app drawer, where I can then search for the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully opened the app drawer, revealing a list of installed applications. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, which is to open the VLC app. The VLC app is not immediately visible on the current screen of the app drawer.\\n Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle-bottom of the screen (e.g., starting swipe at y=700, x=500 and ending at y=300, x=500) to scroll down the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal more apps in the app drawer, hopefully including the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. The VLC app icon is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[837,840],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the VLC app icon, which is an orange traffic cone icon with the text \\'VLC\\' below it, located in the bottom right of the screen. This action is expected to open the VLC application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the VLC app icon was successful. The VLC application opened, and it is currently displaying the \\'Playlists\\' section, as indicated by the highlighted \\'Playlists\\' tab at the bottom of the screen. The screen shows a message \\'No media files found...\\'. This action successfully completed the active subgoal \\'Open VLC App\\' and has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,936],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen. The icon is represented by three vertical dots. This action is expected to open a menu containing options, hopefully including an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at the top right successfully opened a small pop-up menu. This menu contains two options: \"Display in list\" and \"Refresh\". Neither of these options allows for the creation of a new playlist. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly (the menu appeared), it did not bring the agent closer to creating a new playlist as intended. A different approach is needed to find the playlist creation feature.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' tab located at the bottom right of the screen. The \\'More\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be available. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'More\\' tab at coordinates [959, 901] resulted in the closure of the previously open pop-up menu. The application did not navigate to the \\'More\\' section; the \\'Playlists\\' tab remains the active view. This action did not bring the agent closer to creating a new playlist because the intended navigation to the \\'More\\' section failed. The most probable reason for this failure is that the tap was interpreted as an action to dismiss the pop-up menu rather than an interaction with the \\'More\\' tab itself. To proceed, the \\'More\\' tab needs to be tapped again.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 5: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[958,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' tab, which is located at the bottom right of the screen (coordinates around [958, 901]). The \\'More\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be available. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"VLC app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"App drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle-bottom of the screen (e.g., starting swipe at y=700, x=500 and ending at y=300, x=500) to scroll down the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal more apps in the app drawer, hopefully including the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. The VLC app icon is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[837,840],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the VLC app icon, which is an orange traffic cone icon with the text \\'VLC\\' below it, located in the bottom right of the screen. This action is expected to open the VLC application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the VLC app icon was successful. The VLC application opened, and it is currently displaying the \\'Playlists\\' section, as indicated by the highlighted \\'Playlists\\' tab at the bottom of the screen. The screen shows a message \\'No media files found...\\'. This action successfully completed the active subgoal \\'Open VLC App\\' and has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,936],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen. The icon is represented by three vertical dots. This action is expected to open a menu containing options, hopefully including an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at the top right successfully opened a small pop-up menu. This menu contains two options: \"Display in list\" and \"Refresh\". Neither of these options allows for the creation of a new playlist. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly (the menu appeared), it did not bring the agent closer to creating a new playlist as intended. A different approach is needed to find the playlist creation feature.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' tab located at the bottom right of the screen. The \\'More\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be available. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'More\\' tab at coordinates [959, 901] resulted in the closure of the previously open pop-up menu. The application did not navigate to the \\'More\\' section; the \\'Playlists\\' tab remains the active view. This action did not bring the agent closer to creating a new playlist because the intended navigation to the \\'More\\' section failed. The most probable reason for this failure is that the tap was interpreted as an action to dismiss the pop-up menu rather than an interaction with the \\'More\\' tab itself. To proceed, the \\'More\\' tab needs to be tapped again.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[958,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' tab, which is located at the bottom right of the screen (coordinates around [958, 901]). The \\'More\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be available. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'More\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated to the \\'More\\' section, which displays options for \\'SETTINGS\\', \\'ABOUT\\', and \\'Streams\\'. However, this section does not offer an option to create a new playlist from local files. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not directly lead to a playlist creation feature. A new approach is needed.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [18, 42, 36, 137], \\'text\\': \\'15.38\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [19, 796, 35, 860], \\'text\\': \\'LTE\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 66, 222], \\'text\\': \\'dX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 66, 362], \\'text\\': \\'dY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Xv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'Yv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 66, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 948], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [74, 156, 96, 251], \\'text\\': \\'VLC\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [159, 196, 176, 386], \\'text\\': \\'SETTINGS\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [160, 709, 175, 836], \\'text\\': \\'ABOUT\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [233, 34, 252, 206], \\'text\\': \\'Streams\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [360, 127, 377, 339], \\'text\\': \\'New stream\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 59, 966, 143], \\'text\\': \\'Video\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 259, 966, 345], \\'text\\': \\'Audio\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 448, 966, 556], \\'text\\': \\'Browse\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [952, 638, 967, 763], \\'text\\': \\'Playlists\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [951, 863, 966, 939], \\'text\\': \\'More\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [272, 33, 396, 429]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 513, 189, 964]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [146, 33, 189, 485]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [914, 220, 991, 382]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 607, 989, 800]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 818, 986, 978]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [17, 247, 38, 296]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 195, 38, 239]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [911, 403, 993, 592]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [913, 6, 996, 194]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [16, 133, 37, 186]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [66, 134, 104, 258]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [12, 789, 40, 950]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [72, 909, 97, 983]}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [153, 62, 183, 126]}\"]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible. To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 1: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[700,500],\"end_point\":[300,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up from the middle-bottom of the screen (e.g., starting swipe at y=700, x=500 and ending at y=300, x=500) to scroll down the app drawer. This action is expected to reveal more apps in the app drawer, hopefully including the VLC app. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the app drawer, revealing more applications. The VLC app icon is now visible on the screen. This action was successful and brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[837,840],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the VLC app icon, which is an orange traffic cone icon with the text \\'VLC\\' below it, located in the bottom right of the screen. This action is expected to open the VLC application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the VLC app icon was successful. The VLC application opened, and it is currently displaying the \\'Playlists\\' section, as indicated by the highlighted \\'Playlists\\' tab at the bottom of the screen. The screen shows a message \\'No media files found...\\'. This action successfully completed the active subgoal \\'Open VLC App\\' and has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,936],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen. The icon is represented by three vertical dots. This action is expected to open a menu containing options, hopefully including an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at the top right successfully opened a small pop-up menu. This menu contains two options: \"Display in list\" and \"Refresh\". Neither of these options allows for the creation of a new playlist. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly (the menu appeared), it did not bring the agent closer to creating a new playlist as intended. A different approach is needed to find the playlist creation feature.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' tab located at the bottom right of the screen. The \\'More\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be available. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'More\\' tab at coordinates [959, 901] resulted in the closure of the previously open pop-up menu. The application did not navigate to the \\'More\\' section; the \\'Playlists\\' tab remains the active view. This action did not bring the agent closer to creating a new playlist because the intended navigation to the \\'More\\' section failed. The most probable reason for this failure is that the tap was interpreted as an action to dismiss the pop-up menu rather than an interaction with the \\'More\\' tab itself. To proceed, the \\'More\\' tab needs to be tapped again.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[958,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' tab, which is located at the bottom right of the screen (coordinates around [958, 901]). The \\'More\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be available. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'More\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated to the \\'More\\' section, which displays options for \\'SETTINGS\\', \\'ABOUT\\', and \\'Streams\\'. However, this section does not offer an option to create a new playlist from local files. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not directly lead to a playlist creation feature. A new approach is needed.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 6: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab, located at the bottom of the screen (coordinates around [959, 502]). The \\'Browse\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, allowing access to local files. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"VLC app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"App drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"},{\"VariableName\":\"AdventureMarathonPlaylistStatus\",\"Content\":\"\",\"Status\":\"This piece of information is sought. No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[837,840],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the VLC app icon, which is an orange traffic cone icon with the text \\'VLC\\' below it, located in the bottom right of the screen. This action is expected to open the VLC application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the VLC app icon was successful. The VLC application opened, and it is currently displaying the \\'Playlists\\' section, as indicated by the highlighted \\'Playlists\\' tab at the bottom of the screen. The screen shows a message \\'No media files found...\\'. This action successfully completed the active subgoal \\'Open VLC App\\' and has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,936],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen. The icon is represented by three vertical dots. This action is expected to open a menu containing options, hopefully including an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at the top right successfully opened a small pop-up menu. This menu contains two options: \"Display in list\" and \"Refresh\". Neither of these options allows for the creation of a new playlist. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly (the menu appeared), it did not bring the agent closer to creating a new playlist as intended. A different approach is needed to find the playlist creation feature.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' tab located at the bottom right of the screen. The \\'More\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be available. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'More\\' tab at coordinates [959, 901] resulted in the closure of the previously open pop-up menu. The application did not navigate to the \\'More\\' section; the \\'Playlists\\' tab remains the active view. This action did not bring the agent closer to creating a new playlist because the intended navigation to the \\'More\\' section failed. The most probable reason for this failure is that the tap was interpreted as an action to dismiss the pop-up menu rather than an interaction with the \\'More\\' tab itself. To proceed, the \\'More\\' tab needs to be tapped again.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[958,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' tab, which is located at the bottom right of the screen (coordinates around [958, 901]). The \\'More\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be available. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'More\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated to the \\'More\\' section, which displays options for \\'SETTINGS\\', \\'ABOUT\\', and \\'Streams\\'. However, this section does not offer an option to create a new playlist from local files. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not directly lead to a playlist creation feature. A new approach is needed.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab, located at the bottom of the screen (coordinates around [959, 502]). The \\'Browse\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, allowing access to local files. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Browse\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated to the \\'Browse\\' section, which displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\', and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to navigate to \\'Internal Memory\\', which is now visible.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 2: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[837,840],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the VLC app icon, which is an orange traffic cone icon with the text \\'VLC\\' below it, located in the bottom right of the screen. This action is expected to open the VLC application. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the VLC app icon was successful. The VLC application opened, and it is currently displaying the \\'Playlists\\' section, as indicated by the highlighted \\'Playlists\\' tab at the bottom of the screen. The screen shows a message \\'No media files found...\\'. This action successfully completed the active subgoal \\'Open VLC App\\' and has brought the agent closer to fulfilling the overall user instruction.\\n Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,936],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen. The icon is represented by three vertical dots. This action is expected to open a menu containing options, hopefully including an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at the top right successfully opened a small pop-up menu. This menu contains two options: \"Display in list\" and \"Refresh\". Neither of these options allows for the creation of a new playlist. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly (the menu appeared), it did not bring the agent closer to creating a new playlist as intended. A different approach is needed to find the playlist creation feature.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' tab located at the bottom right of the screen. The \\'More\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be available. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'More\\' tab at coordinates [959, 901] resulted in the closure of the previously open pop-up menu. The application did not navigate to the \\'More\\' section; the \\'Playlists\\' tab remains the active view. This action did not bring the agent closer to creating a new playlist because the intended navigation to the \\'More\\' section failed. The most probable reason for this failure is that the tap was interpreted as an action to dismiss the pop-up menu rather than an interaction with the \\'More\\' tab itself. To proceed, the \\'More\\' tab needs to be tapped again.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[958,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' tab, which is located at the bottom right of the screen (coordinates around [958, 901]). The \\'More\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be available. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'More\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated to the \\'More\\' section, which displays options for \\'SETTINGS\\', \\'ABOUT\\', and \\'Streams\\'. However, this section does not offer an option to create a new playlist from local files. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not directly lead to a playlist creation feature. A new approach is needed.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab, located at the bottom of the screen (coordinates around [959, 502]). The \\'Browse\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, allowing access to local files. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Browse\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated to the \\'Browse\\' section, which displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\', and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to navigate to \\'Internal Memory\\', which is now visible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 7: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'nory Inte\\' (Internal memory) under \\'Storages\\'. The element is represented by a folder icon and the text \\'nory Inte\\'. This action is expected to open the internal storage directory. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"VLC app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"App drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,936],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen. The icon is represented by three vertical dots. This action is expected to open a menu containing options, hopefully including an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at the top right successfully opened a small pop-up menu. This menu contains two options: \"Display in list\" and \"Refresh\". Neither of these options allows for the creation of a new playlist. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly (the menu appeared), it did not bring the agent closer to creating a new playlist as intended. A different approach is needed to find the playlist creation feature.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' tab located at the bottom right of the screen. The \\'More\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be available. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'More\\' tab at coordinates [959, 901] resulted in the closure of the previously open pop-up menu. The application did not navigate to the \\'More\\' section; the \\'Playlists\\' tab remains the active view. This action did not bring the agent closer to creating a new playlist because the intended navigation to the \\'More\\' section failed. The most probable reason for this failure is that the tap was interpreted as an action to dismiss the pop-up menu rather than an interaction with the \\'More\\' tab itself. To proceed, the \\'More\\' tab needs to be tapped again.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[958,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' tab, which is located at the bottom right of the screen (coordinates around [958, 901]). The \\'More\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be available. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'More\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated to the \\'More\\' section, which displays options for \\'SETTINGS\\', \\'ABOUT\\', and \\'Streams\\'. However, this section does not offer an option to create a new playlist from local files. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not directly lead to a playlist creation feature. A new approach is needed.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab, located at the bottom of the screen (coordinates around [959, 502]). The \\'Browse\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, allowing access to local files. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Browse\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated to the \\'Browse\\' section, which displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\', and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to navigate to \\'Internal Memory\\', which is now visible.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'nory Inte\\' (Internal memory) under \\'Storages\\'. The element is represented by a folder icon and the text \\'nory Inte\\'. This action is expected to open the internal storage directory. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Internal memory\\' was successful. The application navigated to the \\'Internal memory\\' directory, displaying a list of folders. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to locate the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder within this directory.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 3: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[83,936],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the three-dot menu icon located at the top right of the screen. The icon is represented by three vertical dots. This action is expected to open a menu containing options, hopefully including an option to create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the three-dot menu icon at the top right successfully opened a small pop-up menu. This menu contains two options: \"Display in list\" and \"Refresh\". Neither of these options allows for the creation of a new playlist. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly (the menu appeared), it did not bring the agent closer to creating a new playlist as intended. A different approach is needed to find the playlist creation feature.\\n Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' tab located at the bottom right of the screen. The \\'More\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be available. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'More\\' tab at coordinates [959, 901] resulted in the closure of the previously open pop-up menu. The application did not navigate to the \\'More\\' section; the \\'Playlists\\' tab remains the active view. This action did not bring the agent closer to creating a new playlist because the intended navigation to the \\'More\\' section failed. The most probable reason for this failure is that the tap was interpreted as an action to dismiss the pop-up menu rather than an interaction with the \\'More\\' tab itself. To proceed, the \\'More\\' tab needs to be tapped again.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[958,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' tab, which is located at the bottom right of the screen (coordinates around [958, 901]). The \\'More\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be available. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'More\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated to the \\'More\\' section, which displays options for \\'SETTINGS\\', \\'ABOUT\\', and \\'Streams\\'. However, this section does not offer an option to create a new playlist from local files. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not directly lead to a playlist creation feature. A new approach is needed.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab, located at the bottom of the screen (coordinates around [959, 502]). The \\'Browse\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, allowing access to local files. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Browse\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated to the \\'Browse\\' section, which displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\', and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to navigate to \\'Internal Memory\\', which is now visible.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'nory Inte\\' (Internal memory) under \\'Storages\\'. The element is represented by a folder icon and the text \\'nory Inte\\'. This action is expected to open the internal storage directory. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Internal memory\\' was successful. The application navigated to the \\'Internal memory\\' directory, displaying a list of folders. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to locate the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder within this directory.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 8: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This action is expected to reveal more folders, hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"VLC app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"App drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"},{\"VariableName\":\"AdventureMarathonPlaylistStatus\",\"Content\":\"\",\"Status\":\"This piece of information is sought. No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The application did not navigate to the \\'More\\' section; the \\'Playlists\\' tab remains the active view. This action did not bring the agent closer to creating a new playlist because the intended navigation to the \\'More\\' section failed. The most probable reason for this failure is that the tap was interpreted as an action to dismiss the pop-up menu rather than an interaction with the \\'More\\' tab itself. To proceed, the \\'More\\' tab needs to be tapped again.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[958,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' tab, which is located at the bottom right of the screen (coordinates around [958, 901]). The \\'More\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be available. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'More\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated to the \\'More\\' section, which displays options for \\'SETTINGS\\', \\'ABOUT\\', and \\'Streams\\'. However, this section does not offer an option to create a new playlist from local files. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not directly lead to a playlist creation feature. A new approach is needed.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab, located at the bottom of the screen (coordinates around [959, 502]). The \\'Browse\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, allowing access to local files. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Browse\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated to the \\'Browse\\' section, which displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\', and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to navigate to \\'Internal Memory\\', which is now visible.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'nory Inte\\' (Internal memory) under \\'Storages\\'. The element is represented by a folder icon and the text \\'nory Inte\\'. This action is expected to open the internal storage directory. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Internal memory\\' was successful. The application navigated to the \\'Internal memory\\' directory, displaying a list of folders. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to locate the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder within this directory.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This action is expected to reveal more folders, hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' directory. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 4: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' tab located at the bottom right of the screen. The \\'More\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be available. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'More\\' tab at coordinates [959, 901] resulted in the closure of the previously open pop-up menu. The application did not navigate to the \\'More\\' section; the \\'Playlists\\' tab remains the active view. This action did not bring the agent closer to creating a new playlist because the intended navigation to the \\'More\\' section failed. The most probable reason for this failure is that the tap was interpreted as an action to dismiss the pop-up menu rather than an interaction with the \\'More\\' tab itself. To proceed, the \\'More\\' tab needs to be tapped again.\\n Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[958,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' tab, which is located at the bottom right of the screen (coordinates around [958, 901]). The \\'More\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be available. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'More\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated to the \\'More\\' section, which displays options for \\'SETTINGS\\', \\'ABOUT\\', and \\'Streams\\'. However, this section does not offer an option to create a new playlist from local files. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not directly lead to a playlist creation feature. A new approach is needed.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab, located at the bottom of the screen (coordinates around [959, 502]). The \\'Browse\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, allowing access to local files. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Browse\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated to the \\'Browse\\' section, which displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\', and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to navigate to \\'Internal Memory\\', which is now visible.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'nory Inte\\' (Internal memory) under \\'Storages\\'. The element is represented by a folder icon and the text \\'nory Inte\\'. This action is expected to open the internal storage directory. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Internal memory\\' was successful. The application navigated to the \\'Internal memory\\' directory, displaying a list of folders. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to locate the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder within this directory.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This action is expected to reveal more folders, hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' directory. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 9: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,272],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is visible at the bottom of the screen. This action is expected to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder and display its contents. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"VLC app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"App drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon.

Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution.

The \\'More\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be available. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'More\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated to the \\'More\\' section, which displays options for \\'SETTINGS\\', \\'ABOUT\\', and \\'Streams\\'. However, this section does not offer an option to create a new playlist from local files. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not directly lead to a playlist creation feature. A new approach is needed.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab, located at the bottom of the screen (coordinates around [959, 502]). The \\'Browse\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, allowing access to local files. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Browse\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated to the \\'Browse\\' section, which displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\', and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to navigate to \\'Internal Memory\\', which is now visible.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'nory Inte\\' (Internal memory) under \\'Storages\\'. The element is represented by a folder icon and the text \\'nory Inte\\'. This action is expected to open the internal storage directory. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Internal memory\\' was successful. The application navigated to the \\'Internal memory\\' directory, displaying a list of folders. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to locate the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder within this directory.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This action is expected to reveal more folders, hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' directory. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,272],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is visible at the bottom of the screen. This action is expected to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder was successful. The application navigated into the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, and the screen now displays a list of video files contained within it. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select the specific video files for the playlist.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 5: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[958,901],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'More\\' tab, which is located at the bottom right of the screen (coordinates around [958, 901]). The \\'More\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'More\\' section of the VLC app, where an option to create a new playlist might be available. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'More\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated to the \\'More\\' section, which displays options for \\'SETTINGS\\', \\'ABOUT\\', and \\'Streams\\'. However, this section does not offer an option to create a new playlist from local files. Therefore, while the action itself was executed correctly, it did not directly lead to a playlist creation feature. A new approach is needed.\\n Step 6: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab, located at the bottom of the screen (coordinates around [959, 502]). The \\'Browse\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, allowing access to local files. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Browse\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated to the \\'Browse\\' section, which displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\', and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to navigate to \\'Internal Memory\\', which is now visible.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'nory Inte\\' (Internal memory) under \\'Storages\\'. The element is represented by a folder icon and the text \\'nory Inte\\'. This action is expected to open the internal storage directory. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Internal memory\\' was successful. The application navigated to the \\'Internal memory\\' directory, displaying a list of folders. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to locate the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder within this directory.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This action is expected to reveal more folders, hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' directory. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,272],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is visible at the bottom of the screen. This action is expected to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder was successful. The application navigated into the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, and the screen now displays a list of video files contained within it. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select the specific video files for the playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 10: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[360,450],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' (center coordinates [360, 450]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to select the file and enter a selection mode, allowing for the selection of multiple files to create a playlist. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"VLC app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"App drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

No content or partial information is currently available.\"}]}\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips that might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab, located at the bottom of the screen (coordinates around [959, 502]). The \\'Browse\\' tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, allowing access to local files. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping the \\'Browse\\' tab was successful. The VLC app navigated to the \\'Browse\\' section, which displays \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\', and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to navigate to \\'Internal Memory\\', which is now visible.\\n Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'nory Inte\\' (Internal memory) under \\'Storages\\'. The element is represented by a folder icon and the text \\'nory Inte\\'. This action is expected to open the internal storage directory. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Internal memory\\' was successful. The application navigated to the \\'Internal memory\\' directory, displaying a list of folders. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to locate the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder within this directory.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This action is expected to reveal more folders, hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' directory. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,272],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is visible at the bottom of the screen. This action is expected to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder was successful. The application navigated into the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, and the screen now displays a list of video files contained within it. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select the specific video files for the playlist.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[360,450],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' (center coordinates [360, 450]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to select the file and enter a selection mode, allowing for the selection of multiple files to create a playlist. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected (highlighted), and the UI indicates \\'1 selected\\' at the top, confirming entry into selection mode. New contextual icons (info, play, delete, sort/filter menu) appeared at the top. This action directly contributes to the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist by selecting the first required file.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 7: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[459,184],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'nory Inte\\' (Internal memory) under \\'Storages\\'. The element is represented by a folder icon and the text \\'nory Inte\\'. This action is expected to open the internal storage directory. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on \\'Internal memory\\' was successful. The application navigated to the \\'Internal memory\\' directory, displaying a list of folders. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to locate the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder within this directory.\\n Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This action is expected to reveal more folders, hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' directory. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,272],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is visible at the bottom of the screen. This action is expected to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder was successful. The application navigated into the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, and the screen now displays a list of video files contained within it. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select the specific video files for the playlist.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[360,450],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' (center coordinates [360, 450]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to select the file and enter a selection mode, allowing for the selection of multiple files to create a playlist. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected (highlighted), and the UI indicates \\'1 selected\\' at the top, confirming entry into selection mode. New contextual icons (info, play, delete, sort/filter menu) appeared at the top. This action directly contributes to the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist by selecting the first required file.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of video files. This is done to find the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' which is needed for the playlist but is not currently visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of video files upwards. As a result, the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\', which was previously not visible, is now visible at the bottom of the screen (bounding box [858, 169, 896, 613]). The files \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' (bounding box [672, 173, 711, 758]) and \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' (bounding box [797, 170, 835, 650]) are also visible. The file \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' remains selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the necessary files visible for selection.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 12: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[877,391],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' (center coordinates [877, 391]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'2 selected\\' should be displayed at the top.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal more folders, hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' directory. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,272],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is visible at the bottom of the screen. This action is expected to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder was successful. The application navigated into the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, and the screen now displays a list of video files contained within it. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select the specific video files for the playlist.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[360,450],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' (center coordinates [360, 450]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to select the file and enter a selection mode, allowing for the selection of multiple files to create a playlist. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected (highlighted), and the UI indicates \\'1 selected\\' at the top, confirming entry into selection mode. New contextual icons (info, play, delete, sort/filter menu) appeared at the top. This action directly contributes to the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist by selecting the first required file.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of video files. This is done to find the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' which is needed for the playlist but is not currently visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of video files upwards. As a result, the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\', which was previously not visible, is now visible at the bottom of the screen (bounding box [858, 169, 896, 613]). The files \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' (bounding box [672, 173, 711, 758]) and \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' (bounding box [797, 170, 835, 650]) are also visible. The file \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' remains selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the necessary files visible for selection.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[877,391],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' (center coordinates [877, 391]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'2 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated to show \\'2 selected\\' at the top. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as two of the four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 8: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This action is expected to reveal more folders, hopefully including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' directory. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is now visible on the screen. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,272],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is visible at the bottom of the screen. This action is expected to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder was successful. The application navigated into the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, and the screen now displays a list of video files contained within it. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select the specific video files for the playlist.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[360,450],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' (center coordinates [360, 450]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to select the file and enter a selection mode, allowing for the selection of multiple files to create a playlist. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected (highlighted), and the UI indicates \\'1 selected\\' at the top, confirming entry into selection mode. New contextual icons (info, play, delete, sort/filter menu) appeared at the top. This action directly contributes to the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist by selecting the first required file.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of video files. This is done to find the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' which is needed for the playlist but is not currently visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of video files upwards. As a result, the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\', which was previously not visible, is now visible at the bottom of the screen (bounding box [858, 169, 896, 613]). The files \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' (bounding box [672, 173, 711, 758]) and \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' (bounding box [797, 170, 835, 650]) are also visible. The file \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' remains selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the necessary files visible for selection.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[877,391],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' (center coordinates [877, 391]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'2 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated to show \\'2 selected\\' at the top. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as two of the four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected. The files \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' and \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' are visible and need to be selected next.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 13: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[691,465],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' (center coordinates approx. [691, 465]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'3 selected\\' should be displayed at the top.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,272],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is visible at the bottom of the screen. This action is expected to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder was successful. The application navigated into the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, and the screen now displays a list of video files contained within it. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select the specific video files for the playlist.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[360,450],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' (center coordinates [360, 450]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to select the file and enter a selection mode, allowing for the selection of multiple files to create a playlist. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected (highlighted), and the UI indicates \\'1 selected\\' at the top, confirming entry into selection mode. New contextual icons (info, play, delete, sort/filter menu) appeared at the top. This action directly contributes to the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist by selecting the first required file.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of video files. This is done to find the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' which is needed for the playlist but is not currently visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of video files upwards. As a result, the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\', which was previously not visible, is now visible at the bottom of the screen (bounding box [858, 169, 896, 613]). The files \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' (bounding box [672, 173, 711, 758]) and \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' (bounding box [797, 170, 835, 650]) are also visible. The file \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' remains selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the necessary files visible for selection.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[877,391],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' (center coordinates [877, 391]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'2 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated to show \\'2 selected\\' at the top. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as two of the four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected. The files \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' and \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' are visible and need to be selected next.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[691,465],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' (center coordinates approx. [691, 465]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'3 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated from \\'2 selected\\' to \\'3 selected\\' at the top. The tapped file is now highlighted. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as three of the four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 9: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,272],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is visible at the bottom of the screen. This action is expected to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder and display its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder was successful. The application navigated into the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, and the screen now displays a list of video files contained within it. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to select the specific video files for the playlist.\\n Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[360,450],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' (center coordinates [360, 450]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to select the file and enter a selection mode, allowing for the selection of multiple files to create a playlist. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected (highlighted), and the UI indicates \\'1 selected\\' at the top, confirming entry into selection mode. New contextual icons (info, play, delete, sort/filter menu) appeared at the top. This action directly contributes to the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist by selecting the first required file.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of video files. This is done to find the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' which is needed for the playlist but is not currently visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of video files upwards. As a result, the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\', which was previously not visible, is now visible at the bottom of the screen (bounding box [858, 169, 896, 613]). The files \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' (bounding box [672, 173, 711, 758]) and \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' (bounding box [797, 170, 835, 650]) are also visible. The file \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' remains selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the necessary files visible for selection.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[877,391],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' (center coordinates [877, 391]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'2 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated to show \\'2 selected\\' at the top. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as two of the four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected. The files \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' and \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' are visible and need to be selected next.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[691,465],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' (center coordinates approx. [691, 465]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'3 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated from \\'2 selected\\' to \\'3 selected\\' at the top. The tapped file is now highlighted. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as three of the four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected. The file \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' is visible and needs to be selected next.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 14: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[360,450],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' (center coordinates [360, 450]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to select the file and enter a selection mode, allowing for the selection of multiple files to create a playlist. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected (highlighted), and the UI indicates \\'1 selected\\' at the top, confirming entry into selection mode. New contextual icons (info, play, delete, sort/filter menu) appeared at the top. This action directly contributes to the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist by selecting the first required file.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of video files. This is done to find the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' which is needed for the playlist but is not currently visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of video files upwards. As a result, the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\', which was previously not visible, is now visible at the bottom of the screen (bounding box [858, 169, 896, 613]). The files \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' (bounding box [672, 173, 711, 758]) and \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' (bounding box [797, 170, 835, 650]) are also visible. The file \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' remains selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the necessary files visible for selection.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[877,391],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' (center coordinates [877, 391]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'2 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated to show \\'2 selected\\' at the top. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as two of the four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected. The files \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' and \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' are visible and need to be selected next.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[691,465],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' (center coordinates approx. [691, 465]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'3 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated from \\'2 selected\\' to \\'3 selected\\' at the top. The tapped file is now highlighted. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as three of the four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected. The file \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' is visible and needs to be selected next.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[816,410],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' (center coordinates approx. [816, 410]). This file is currently visible in the list and is not selected. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'4 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated from \\'3 selected\\' to \\'4 selected\\' at the top. The tapped file is now highlighted. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as all four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 10: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[360,450],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' (center coordinates [360, 450]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to select the file and enter a selection mode, allowing for the selection of multiple files to create a playlist. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected (highlighted), and the UI indicates \\'1 selected\\' at the top, confirming entry into selection mode. New contextual icons (info, play, delete, sort/filter menu) appeared at the top. This action directly contributes to the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist by selecting the first required file.\\n Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of video files. This is done to find the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' which is needed for the playlist but is not currently visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of video files upwards. As a result, the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\', which was previously not visible, is now visible at the bottom of the screen (bounding box [858, 169, 896, 613]). The files \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' (bounding box [672, 173, 711, 758]) and \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' (bounding box [797, 170, 835, 650]) are also visible. The file \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' remains selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the necessary files visible for selection.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[877,391],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' (center coordinates [877, 391]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'2 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated to show \\'2 selected\\' at the top. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as two of the four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected. The files \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' and \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' are visible and need to be selected next.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[691,465],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' (center coordinates approx. [691, 465]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'3 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated from \\'2 selected\\' to \\'3 selected\\' at the top. The tapped file is now highlighted. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as three of the four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected. The file \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' is visible and needs to be selected next.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[816,410],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' (center coordinates approx. [816, 410]). This file is currently visible in the list and is not selected. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'4 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated from \\'3 selected\\' to \\'4 selected\\' at the top. The tapped file is now highlighted. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as all four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected. The next steps involve using the menu to create the playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 15: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,930],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the menu icon (three horizontal lines with a plus sign) located at the top right of the screen (center coordinates approx. [84, 930]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options to manage the selected files, including an option to add them to a playlist or create a new playlist.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is done to find the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' which is needed for the playlist but is not currently visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of video files upwards. As a result, the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\', which was previously not visible, is now visible at the bottom of the screen (bounding box [858, 169, 896, 613]). The files \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' (bounding box [672, 173, 711, 758]) and \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' (bounding box [797, 170, 835, 650]) are also visible. The file \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' remains selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the necessary files visible for selection.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[877,391],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' (center coordinates [877, 391]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'2 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated to show \\'2 selected\\' at the top. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as two of the four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected. The files \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' and \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' are visible and need to be selected next.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[691,465],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' (center coordinates approx. [691, 465]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'3 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated from \\'2 selected\\' to \\'3 selected\\' at the top. The tapped file is now highlighted. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as three of the four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected. The file \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' is visible and needs to be selected next.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[816,410],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' (center coordinates approx. [816, 410]). This file is currently visible in the list and is not selected. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'4 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated from \\'3 selected\\' to \\'4 selected\\' at the top. The tapped file is now highlighted. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as all four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected. The next steps involve using the menu to create the playlist.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,930],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the menu icon (three horizontal lines with a plus sign) located at the top right of the screen (center coordinates approx. [84, 930]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options to manage the selected files, including an option to add them to a playlist or create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the menu icon (coordinates [84, 930]) was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen, offering options to \"Add to new playlist\" or \"Add to existing playlist\". This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist, as the interface for naming and saving the new playlist is now active.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18.

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 11: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen from [800, 500] to [200, 500] to scroll down the list of video files. This is done to find the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' which is needed for the playlist but is not currently visible. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of video files upwards. As a result, the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\', which was previously not visible, is now visible at the bottom of the screen (bounding box [858, 169, 896, 613]). The files \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' (bounding box [672, 173, 711, 758]) and \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' (bounding box [797, 170, 835, 650]) are also visible. The file \\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4\\' remains selected. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by making the necessary files visible for selection.\\n Step 12: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[877,391],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' (center coordinates [877, 391]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'2 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated to show \\'2 selected\\' at the top. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as two of the four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected. The files \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' and \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' are visible and need to be selected next.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[691,465],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' (center coordinates approx. [691, 465]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'3 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated from \\'2 selected\\' to \\'3 selected\\' at the top. The tapped file is now highlighted. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as three of the four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected. The file \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' is visible and needs to be selected next.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[816,410],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' (center coordinates approx. [816, 410]). This file is currently visible in the list and is not selected. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'4 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated from \\'3 selected\\' to \\'4 selected\\' at the top. The tapped file is now highlighted. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as all four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected. The next steps involve using the menu to create the playlist.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,930],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the menu icon (three horizontal lines with a plus sign) located at the top right of the screen (center coordinates approx. [84, 930]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options to manage the selected files, including an option to add them to a playlist or create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the menu icon (coordinates [84, 930]) was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen, offering options to \"Add to new playlist\" or \"Add to existing playlist\". This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist, as the interface for naming and saving the new playlist is now active.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 16: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,412],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (center coordinates approx. [844, 412]). This text field is currently empty. This action is expected to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing the playlist name to be entered. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"VLC app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"App drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated from \\'3 selected\\' to \\'4 selected\\' at the top. The tapped file is now highlighted. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as all four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected. The next steps involve using the menu to create the playlist.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,930],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the menu icon (three horizontal lines with a plus sign) located at the top right of the screen (center coordinates approx. [84, 930]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options to manage the selected files, including an option to add them to a playlist or create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the menu icon (coordinates [84, 930]) was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen, offering options to \"Add to new playlist\" or \"Add to existing playlist\". This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist, as the interface for naming and saving the new playlist is now active.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,412],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (center coordinates approx. [844, 412]). This text field is currently empty. This action is expected to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing the playlist name to be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (coordinates approx. [844, 412]) was successful. The text field became focused, and the virtual keyboard appeared at the bottom of the screen. This allows for text input into the \\'Playlist name\\' field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"Playlist name\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'2 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated to show \\'2 selected\\' at the top. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as two of the four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected. The files \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' and \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' are visible and need to be selected next.\\n Step 13: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

[691, 465]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'3 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated from \\'2 selected\\' to \\'3 selected\\' at the top. The tapped file is now highlighted. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as three of the four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected. The file \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' is visible and needs to be selected next.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[816,410],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' (center coordinates approx. [816, 410]). This file is currently visible in the list and is not selected. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'4 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated from \\'3 selected\\' to \\'4 selected\\' at the top. The tapped file is now highlighted. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as all four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,930],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the menu icon (three horizontal lines with a plus sign) located at the top right of the screen (center coordinates approx. [84, 930]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options to manage the selected files, including an option to add them to a playlist or create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the menu icon (coordinates [84, 930]) was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen, offering options to \"Add to new playlist\" or \"Add to existing playlist\". This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist, as the interface for naming and saving the new playlist is now active.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (coordinates approx. [844, 412]) was successful. The text field became focused, and the virtual keyboard appeared at the bottom of the screen. This allows for text input into the \\'Playlist name\\' field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 17: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ultimate Fails Series\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field is currently empty (or contains placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'). After this action, the text field should contain \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider.

[691, 465]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'3 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated from \\'2 selected\\' to \\'3 selected\\' at the top. The tapped file is now highlighted. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as three of the four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected. The file \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' is visible and needs to be selected next.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[816,410],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' (center coordinates approx. [816, 410]). This file is currently visible in the list and is not selected. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'4 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated from \\'3 selected\\' to \\'4 selected\\' at the top. The tapped file is now highlighted. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as all four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected. The next steps involve using the menu to create the playlist.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,930],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the menu icon (three horizontal lines with a plus sign) located at the top right of the screen (center coordinates approx. [84, 930]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options to manage the selected files, including an option to add them to a playlist or create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the menu icon (coordinates [84, 930]) was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen, offering options to \"Add to new playlist\" or \"Add to existing playlist\". This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist, as the interface for naming and saving the new playlist is now active.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,412],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (center coordinates approx. [844, 412]). This text field is currently empty. This action is expected to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing the playlist name to be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (coordinates approx. [844, 412]) was successful. The text field became focused, and the virtual keyboard appeared at the bottom of the screen. This allows for text input into the \\'Playlist name\\' field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ultimate Fails Series\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field is currently empty (or contains placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'). After this action, the text field should contain \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' as shown in the second screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"Ultimate Fails Series\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[691,465],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' (center coordinates approx. [691, 465]). This file is currently visible in the list. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'3 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated from \\'2 selected\\' to \\'3 selected\\' at the top. The tapped file is now highlighted. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as three of the four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected. The file \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' is visible and needs to be selected next.\\n Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[816,410],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' (center coordinates approx. [816, 410]). This file is currently visible in the list and is not selected. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'4 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated from \\'3 selected\\' to \\'4 selected\\' at the top. The tapped file is now highlighted. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as all four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected. The next steps involve using the menu to create the playlist.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,930],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the menu icon (three horizontal lines with a plus sign) located at the top right of the screen (center coordinates approx. [84, 930]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options to manage the selected files, including an option to add them to a playlist or create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the menu icon (coordinates [84, 930]) was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen, offering options to \"Add to new playlist\" or \"Add to existing playlist\". This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist, as the interface for naming and saving the new playlist is now active.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,412],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (center coordinates approx. [844, 412]). This text field is currently empty. This action is expected to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing the playlist name to be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (coordinates approx. [844, 412]) was successful. The text field became focused, and the virtual keyboard appeared at the bottom of the screen. This allows for text input into the \\'Playlist name\\' field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ultimate Fails Series\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field is currently empty (or contains placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'). After this action, the text field should contain \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' as shown in the second screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 18: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button (text at [836, 853, 852, 954], center approx. [844, 903]). This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to save the new playlist with the name \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' and the four selected files. After this action, the dialog box should close, and the playlist should be created. The Actual Outcome of the latest Action is something you have to judge.\\nA Plan is a list of Subgoals that can be sequentially executed and aim to fulfill the user instruction.\\n\\n### Current Plan ###\\n{\"Subgoals\":[{\"ID\":1,\"Title\":\"Open VLC App\",\"CompletionCriteria\":\"VLC app is open and its main interface is visible.\",\"ProgressDescription\":\"App drawer was opened by swiping up on the home screen.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

After this action, \\'4 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated from \\'3 selected\\' to \\'4 selected\\' at the top. The tapped file is now highlighted. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as all four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected. The next steps involve using the menu to create the playlist.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,930],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the menu icon (three horizontal lines with a plus sign) located at the top right of the screen (center coordinates approx.

Actual Outcome: The tap action on the menu icon (coordinates [84, 930]) was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen, offering options to \"Add to new playlist\" or \"Add to existing playlist\". This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist, as the interface for naming and saving the new playlist is now active.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (coordinates approx. [844, 412]) was successful. The text field became focused, and the virtual keyboard appeared at the bottom of the screen. This allows for text input into the \\'Playlist name\\' field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ultimate Fails Series\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field is currently empty (or contains placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'). After this action, the text field should contain \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' as shown in the second screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button (text at [836, 853, 852, 954], center approx. [844, 903]). This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to save the new playlist with the name \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' and the four selected files. After this action, the dialog box should close, and the playlist should be created. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' is presumed to be created. The screen returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the creation step is done. The immediate next step is to verify the playlist\\'s existence and contents.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 14: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[816,410],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' (center coordinates approx. [816, 410]). This file is currently visible in the list and is not selected. This action is expected to add the file to the current selection. After this action, \\'4 selected\\' should be displayed at the top. Actual Outcome: The tap action on \\'recording_61_4K_final.mp4\\' was successful. The file was added to the current selection, and the UI updated from \\'3 selected\\' to \\'4 selected\\' at the top. The tapped file is now highlighted. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as all four required files for the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist are now selected. The next steps involve using the menu to create the playlist.\\n Step 15: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,930],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the menu icon (three horizontal lines with a plus sign) located at the top right of the screen (center coordinates approx. [84, 930]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options to manage the selected files, including an option to add them to a playlist or create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the menu icon (coordinates [84, 930]) was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen, offering options to \"Add to new playlist\" or \"Add to existing playlist\". This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist, as the interface for naming and saving the new playlist is now active.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,412],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (center coordinates approx. [844, 412]). This text field is currently empty. This action is expected to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing the playlist name to be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (coordinates approx. [844, 412]) was successful. The text field became focused, and the virtual keyboard appeared at the bottom of the screen. This allows for text input into the \\'Playlist name\\' field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ultimate Fails Series\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field is currently empty (or contains placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'). After this action, the text field should contain \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' as shown in the second screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button (text at [836, 853, 852, 954], center approx. [844, 903]). This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to save the new playlist with the name \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' and the four selected files. After this action, the dialog box should close, and the playlist should be created. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' is presumed to be created. The screen returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the creation step is done. The immediate next step is to verify the playlist\\'s existence and contents.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 19: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button. The current screen shows the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. This action is expected to navigate one level up in the folder hierarchy, to the \\'Internal Memory\\' folder.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,930],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the menu icon (three horizontal lines with a plus sign) located at the top right of the screen (center coordinates approx. [84, 930]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options to manage the selected files, including an option to add them to a playlist or create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the menu icon (coordinates [84, 930]) was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen, offering options to \"Add to new playlist\" or \"Add to existing playlist\". This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist, as the interface for naming and saving the new playlist is now active.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,412],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (center coordinates approx. [844, 412]). This text field is currently empty. This action is expected to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing the playlist name to be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (coordinates approx. [844, 412]) was successful. The text field became focused, and the virtual keyboard appeared at the bottom of the screen. This allows for text input into the \\'Playlist name\\' field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ultimate Fails Series\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field is currently empty (or contains placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'). After this action, the text field should contain \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' as shown in the second screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button (text at [836, 853, 852, 954], center approx. [844, 903]). This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to save the new playlist with the name \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' and the four selected files. After this action, the dialog box should close, and the playlist should be created. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' is presumed to be created. The screen returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the creation step is done. The immediate next step is to verify the playlist\\'s existence and contents.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button. The current screen shows the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. This action is expected to navigate one level up in the folder hierarchy, to the \\'Internal Memory\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' action was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. This is a positive step towards verifying the playlist creation, as it moves closer to the main navigation area of the app where the \\'Playlists\\' tab is expected to be found.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,930],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the menu icon (three horizontal lines with a plus sign) located at the top right of the screen (center coordinates approx. [84, 930]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options to manage the selected files, including an option to add them to a playlist or create a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the menu icon (coordinates [84, 930]) was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen, offering options to \"Add to new playlist\" or \"Add to existing playlist\". This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist, as the interface for naming and saving the new playlist is now active.\\n Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,412],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (center coordinates approx. [844, 412]). This text field is currently empty. This action is expected to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing the playlist name to be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (coordinates approx. [844, 412]) was successful. The text field became focused, and the virtual keyboard appeared at the bottom of the screen. This allows for text input into the \\'Playlist name\\' field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ultimate Fails Series\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field is currently empty (or contains placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'). After this action, the text field should contain \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' as shown in the second screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button (text at [836, 853, 852, 954], center approx. [844, 903]). This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to save the new playlist with the name \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' and the four selected files. After this action, the dialog box should close, and the playlist should be created. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' is presumed to be created. The screen returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the creation step is done. The immediate next step is to verify the playlist\\'s existence and contents.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button. The current screen shows the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. This action is expected to navigate one level up in the folder hierarchy, to the \\'Internal Memory\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' action was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. This is a positive step towards verifying the playlist creation, as it moves closer to the main navigation area of the app where the \\'Playlists\\' tab is expected to be found.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 20: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button. The current screen shows the \\'Internal memory\\' folder. This action is expected to navigate one level up, to the \\'Browse\\' main screen or the main VLC interface, where the \\'Playlists\\' tab should be accessible.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,412],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (center coordinates approx. [844, 412]). This text field is currently empty. This action is expected to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing the playlist name to be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (coordinates approx. [844, 412]) was successful. The text field became focused, and the virtual keyboard appeared at the bottom of the screen. This allows for text input into the \\'Playlist name\\' field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ultimate Fails Series\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field is currently empty (or contains placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'). After this action, the text field should contain \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' as shown in the second screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button (text at [836, 853, 852, 954], center approx. [844, 903]). This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to save the new playlist with the name \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' and the four selected files. After this action, the dialog box should close, and the playlist should be created. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' is presumed to be created. The screen returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the creation step is done. The immediate next step is to verify the playlist\\'s existence and contents.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button. The current screen shows the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. This action is expected to navigate one level up in the folder hierarchy, to the \\'Internal Memory\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' action was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. This is a positive step towards verifying the playlist creation, as it moves closer to the main navigation area of the app where the \\'Playlists\\' tab is expected to be found.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button. The current screen shows the \\'Internal memory\\' folder. This action is expected to navigate one level up, to the \\'Browse\\' main screen or the main VLC interface, where the \\'Playlists\\' tab should be accessible. Actual Outcome: The \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' action was successful. The screen changed from the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view to the main VLC \\'Browse\\' screen.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 16: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,412],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (center coordinates approx. [844, 412]). This text field is currently empty. This action is expected to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing the playlist name to be entered. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (coordinates approx. [844, 412]) was successful. The text field became focused, and the virtual keyboard appeared at the bottom of the screen. This allows for text input into the \\'Playlist name\\' field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ultimate Fails Series\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field is currently empty (or contains placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'). After this action, the text field should contain \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' as shown in the second screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button (text at [836, 853, 852, 954], center approx. [844, 903]). This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to save the new playlist with the name \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' and the four selected files. After this action, the dialog box should close, and the playlist should be created. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' is presumed to be created. The screen returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the creation step is done. The immediate next step is to verify the playlist\\'s existence and contents.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button. The current screen shows the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. This action is expected to navigate one level up in the folder hierarchy, to the \\'Internal Memory\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' action was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. This is a positive step towards verifying the playlist creation, as it moves closer to the main navigation area of the app where the \\'Playlists\\' tab is expected to be found.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button. The current screen shows the \\'Internal memory\\' folder. This action is expected to navigate one level up, to the \\'Browse\\' main screen or the main VLC interface, where the \\'Playlists\\' tab should be accessible. Actual Outcome: The \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' action was successful. The screen changed from the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view to the main VLC \\'Browse\\' screen. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because the \\'Playlists\\' tab, necessary for verifying the playlist, is now accessible.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 21: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab (text \\'Playlists\\' at [952, 638, 967, 763], center approx. [959, 700]). This tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Playlists\\' section of the VLC app, where the newly created playlist can be found and verified.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field is currently empty (or contains placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'). After this action, the text field should contain \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' as shown in the second screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button (text at [836, 853, 852, 954], center approx. [844, 903]). This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to save the new playlist with the name \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' and the four selected files. After this action, the dialog box should close, and the playlist should be created. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' is presumed to be created. The screen returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the creation step is done. The immediate next step is to verify the playlist\\'s existence and contents.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button. The current screen shows the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. This action is expected to navigate one level up in the folder hierarchy, to the \\'Internal Memory\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' action was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. This is a positive step towards verifying the playlist creation, as it moves closer to the main navigation area of the app where the \\'Playlists\\' tab is expected to be found.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button. The current screen shows the \\'Internal memory\\' folder. This action is expected to navigate one level up, to the \\'Browse\\' main screen or the main VLC interface, where the \\'Playlists\\' tab should be accessible. Actual Outcome: The \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' action was successful. The screen changed from the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view to the main VLC \\'Browse\\' screen. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because the \\'Playlists\\' tab, necessary for verifying the playlist, is now accessible.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab (text \\'Playlists\\' at [952, 638, 967, 763], center approx. [959, 700]). This tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Playlists\\' section of the VLC app, where the newly created playlist can be found and verified. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab (coordinates approx. [959, 700]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' is now visible, which is the playlist that was just created. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of verifying the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 17: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Ultimate Fails Series\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field is currently empty (or contains placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'). After this action, the text field should contain \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\'. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' as shown in the second screenshot. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button (text at [836, 853, 852, 954], center approx. [844, 903]). This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to save the new playlist with the name \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' and the four selected files. After this action, the dialog box should close, and the playlist should be created. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' is presumed to be created. The screen returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the creation step is done. The immediate next step is to verify the playlist\\'s existence and contents.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button. The current screen shows the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. This action is expected to navigate one level up in the folder hierarchy, to the \\'Internal Memory\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' action was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. This is a positive step towards verifying the playlist creation, as it moves closer to the main navigation area of the app where the \\'Playlists\\' tab is expected to be found.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button. The current screen shows the \\'Internal memory\\' folder. This action is expected to navigate one level up, to the \\'Browse\\' main screen or the main VLC interface, where the \\'Playlists\\' tab should be accessible. Actual Outcome: The \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' action was successful. The screen changed from the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view to the main VLC \\'Browse\\' screen. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because the \\'Playlists\\' tab, necessary for verifying the playlist, is now accessible.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab (text \\'Playlists\\' at [952, 638, 967, 763], center approx. [959, 700]). This tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Playlists\\' section of the VLC app, where the newly created playlist can be found and verified. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab (coordinates approx. [959, 700]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' is now visible, which is the playlist that was just created. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of verifying the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 22: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button (text at [836, 853, 852, 954], center approx. [844, 903]). This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to save the new playlist with the name \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' and the four selected files. After this action, the dialog box should close, and the playlist should be created. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' is presumed to be created. The screen returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the creation step is done. The immediate next step is to verify the playlist\\'s existence and contents.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button. The current screen shows the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. This action is expected to navigate one level up in the folder hierarchy, to the \\'Internal Memory\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' action was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. This is a positive step towards verifying the playlist creation, as it moves closer to the main navigation area of the app where the \\'Playlists\\' tab is expected to be found.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button. The current screen shows the \\'Internal memory\\' folder. This action is expected to navigate one level up, to the \\'Browse\\' main screen or the main VLC interface, where the \\'Playlists\\' tab should be accessible. Actual Outcome: The \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' action was successful. The screen changed from the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view to the main VLC \\'Browse\\' screen. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because the \\'Playlists\\' tab, necessary for verifying the playlist, is now accessible.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab (text \\'Playlists\\' at [952, 638, 967, 763], center approx. [959, 700]). This tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Playlists\\' section of the VLC app, where the newly created playlist can be found and verified. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab (coordinates approx. [959, 700]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' is now visible, which is the playlist that was just created. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of verifying the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,211],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist (text at [380, 45, 417, 377], center approx. [398, 211]). This playlist is currently visible. This action is expected to open the playlist, allowing verification of its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist was successful. The screen changed to display the contents of the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist. The listed files (\\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_\\', \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6\\', \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27\\', \\'recording_61_4K_final\\') and their order match the requirements. This allowed for the successful verification of the playlist, completing a key step of the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 18: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[844,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button (text at [836, 853, 852, 954], center approx. [844, 903]). This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to save the new playlist with the name \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' and the four selected files. After this action, the dialog box should close, and the playlist should be created. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' is presumed to be created. The screen returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This action moves the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the creation step is done. The immediate next step is to verify the playlist\\'s existence and contents.\\n Step 19: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button. The current screen shows the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. This action is expected to navigate one level up in the folder hierarchy, to the \\'Internal Memory\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' action was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. This is a positive step towards verifying the playlist creation, as it moves closer to the main navigation area of the app where the \\'Playlists\\' tab is expected to be found.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button. The current screen shows the \\'Internal memory\\' folder. This action is expected to navigate one level up, to the \\'Browse\\' main screen or the main VLC interface, where the \\'Playlists\\' tab should be accessible. Actual Outcome: The \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' action was successful. The screen changed from the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view to the main VLC \\'Browse\\' screen. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because the \\'Playlists\\' tab, necessary for verifying the playlist, is now accessible.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab (text \\'Playlists\\' at [952, 638, 967, 763], center approx. [959, 700]). This tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Playlists\\' section of the VLC app, where the newly created playlist can be found and verified. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab (coordinates approx. [959, 700]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' is now visible, which is the playlist that was just created. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of verifying the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,211],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist (text at [380, 45, 417, 377], center approx. [398, 211]). This playlist is currently visible. This action is expected to open the playlist, allowing verification of its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist was successful. The screen changed to display the contents of the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist. The listed files (\\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_\\', \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6\\', \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27\\', \\'recording_61_4K_final\\') and their order match the requirements. This allowed for the successful verification of the playlist, completing a key step of the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 23: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to navigate from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist content view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen, where all created playlists are listed.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The current screen shows the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. This action is expected to navigate one level up in the folder hierarchy, to the \\'Internal Memory\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' action was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. This is a positive step towards verifying the playlist creation, as it moves closer to the main navigation area of the app where the \\'Playlists\\' tab is expected to be found.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button. The current screen shows the \\'Internal memory\\' folder. This action is expected to navigate one level up, to the \\'Browse\\' main screen or the main VLC interface, where the \\'Playlists\\' tab should be accessible. Actual Outcome: The \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' action was successful. The screen changed from the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view to the main VLC \\'Browse\\' screen. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because the \\'Playlists\\' tab, necessary for verifying the playlist, is now accessible.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

[959, 700]). This tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Playlists\\' section of the VLC app, where the newly created playlist can be found and verified. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab (coordinates approx. [959, 700]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' is now visible, which is the playlist that was just created.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,211],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist (text at [380, 45, 417, 377], center approx. [398, 211]). This playlist is currently visible. This action is expected to open the playlist, allowing verification of its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist was successful. The screen changed to display the contents of the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist. The listed files (\\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_\\', \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6\\', \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27\\', \\'recording_61_4K_final\\') and their order match the requirements.

This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to navigate from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist content view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen, where all created playlists are listed. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximate center [85, 69]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist content view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen. This action brings the agent to the correct starting point to initiate the creation of the second playlist, \\'Adventure Marathon\\', by first navigating to the files.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below.

The current screen shows the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. This action is expected to navigate one level up in the folder hierarchy, to the \\'Internal Memory\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' action was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. This is a positive step towards verifying the playlist creation, as it moves closer to the main navigation area of the app where the \\'Playlists\\' tab is expected to be found.\\n Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button. The current screen shows the \\'Internal memory\\' folder. This action is expected to navigate one level up, to the \\'Browse\\' main screen or the main VLC interface, where the \\'Playlists\\' tab should be accessible. Actual Outcome: The \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' action was successful. The screen changed from the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view to the main VLC \\'Browse\\' screen. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because the \\'Playlists\\' tab, necessary for verifying the playlist, is now accessible.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab (text \\'Playlists\\' at [952, 638, 967, 763], center approx. [959, 700]). This tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Playlists\\' section of the VLC app, where the newly created playlist can be found and verified. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab (coordinates approx. [959, 700]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' is now visible, which is the playlist that was just created. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of verifying the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,211],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist (text at [380, 45, 417, 377], center approx. [398, 211]). This playlist is currently visible. This action is expected to open the playlist, allowing verification of its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist was successful. The screen changed to display the contents of the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist. The listed files (\\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_\\', \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6\\', \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27\\', \\'recording_61_4K_final\\') and their order match the requirements. This allowed for the successful verification of the playlist, completing a key step of the active subgoal.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,69],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top-left of the screen (approximate center [85, 69]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to navigate from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist content view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen, where all created playlists are listed. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximate center [85, 69]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist content view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen. This action brings the agent to the correct starting point to initiate the creation of the second playlist, \\'Adventure Marathon\\', by first navigating to the files.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 24: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 20: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button. The current screen shows the \\'Internal memory\\' folder. This action is expected to navigate one level up, to the \\'Browse\\' main screen or the main VLC interface, where the \\'Playlists\\' tab should be accessible. Actual Outcome: The \\'KEYCODE_BACK\\' action was successful. The screen changed from the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view to the main VLC \\'Browse\\' screen. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal because the \\'Playlists\\' tab, necessary for verifying the playlist, is now accessible.\\n Step 21: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab (text \\'Playlists\\' at [952, 638, 967, 763], center approx. [959, 700]). This tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Playlists\\' section of the VLC app, where the newly created playlist can be found and verified. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab (coordinates approx. [959, 700]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' is now visible, which is the playlist that was just created. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of verifying the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,211],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist (text at [380, 45, 417, 377], center approx. [398, 211]). This playlist is currently visible. This action is expected to open the playlist, allowing verification of its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist was successful. The screen changed to display the contents of the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist. The listed files (\\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_\\', \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6\\', \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27\\', \\'recording_61_4K_final\\') and their order match the requirements. This allowed for the successful verification of the playlist, completing a key step of the active subgoal.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,69],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top-left of the screen (approximate center [85, 69]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to navigate from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist content view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen, where all created playlists are listed. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximate center [85, 69]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist content view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen. This action brings the agent to the correct starting point to initiate the creation of the second playlist, \\'Adventure Marathon\\', by first navigating to the files.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab (text \\'Browse\\' at [952, 448, 966, 556], center approx. [959, 502]). This tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, where files can be located. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab (coordinates approx. [959, 502]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. The \\'Browse\\' tab is now highlighted, and the screen displays options like \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing navigation to the required files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 25: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar.

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab (text \\'Playlists\\' at [952, 638, 967, 763], center approx. [959, 700]). This tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Playlists\\' section of the VLC app, where the newly created playlist can be found and verified. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab (coordinates approx. [959, 700]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' is now visible, which is the playlist that was just created. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of verifying the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,211],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist (text at [380, 45, 417, 377], center approx. [398, 211]). This playlist is currently visible. This action is expected to open the playlist, allowing verification of its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist was successful. The screen changed to display the contents of the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist. The listed files (\\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_\\', \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6\\', \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27\\', \\'recording_61_4K_final\\') and their order match the requirements. This allowed for the successful verification of the playlist, completing a key step of the active subgoal.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,69],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top-left of the screen (approximate center [85, 69]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to navigate from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist content view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen, where all created playlists are listed. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximate center [85, 69]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist content view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen. This action brings the agent to the correct starting point to initiate the creation of the second playlist, \\'Adventure Marathon\\', by first navigating to the files.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab (text \\'Browse\\' at [952, 448, 966, 556], center approx. [959, 502]). This tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, where files can be located. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab (coordinates approx. [959, 502]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. The \\'Browse\\' tab is now highlighted, and the screen displays options like \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing navigation to the required files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[485,180],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Internal memory\\' (text \\'Inter\\' at [484, 179, 498, 252] and \\'ory\\' at [487, 57, 517, 135], center approx. [485, 180]). This item is currently visible. This action is expected to open the internal storage, allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Internal memory\\' (coordinates approx. [485, 180]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the main \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. The screen now lists the contents of the internal storage. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder where the required files are located.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

[959, 700]). This tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Playlists\\' section of the VLC app, where the newly created playlist can be found and verified. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab (coordinates approx. [959, 700]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Playlists\\' screen. The playlist \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' is now visible, which is the playlist that was just created. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of verifying the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist.\\n Step 22: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,211],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist (text at [380, 45, 417, 377], center approx. [398, 211]). This playlist is currently visible. This action is expected to open the playlist, allowing verification of its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist was successful. The screen changed to display the contents of the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist. The listed files (\\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_\\', \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6\\', \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27\\', \\'recording_61_4K_final\\') and their order match the requirements. This allowed for the successful verification of the playlist, completing a key step of the active subgoal.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,69],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top-left of the screen (approximate center [85, 69]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to navigate from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist content view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen, where all created playlists are listed. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximate center [85, 69]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist content view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen. This action brings the agent to the correct starting point to initiate the creation of the second playlist, \\'Adventure Marathon\\', by first navigating to the files.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab (coordinates approx. [959, 502]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. The \\'Browse\\' tab is now highlighted, and the screen displays options like \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing navigation to the required files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[485,180],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Internal memory\\' (text \\'Inter\\' at [484, 179, 498, 252] and \\'ory\\' at [487, 57, 517, 135], center approx.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

[398, 211]). This playlist is currently visible. This action is expected to open the playlist, allowing verification of its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist was successful. The screen changed to display the contents of the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist. The listed files (\\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_\\', \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6\\', \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27\\', \\'recording_61_4K_final\\') and their order match the requirements. This allowed for the successful verification of the playlist, completing a key step of the active subgoal.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,69],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top-left of the screen (approximate center [85, 69]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to navigate from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist content view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen, where all created playlists are listed. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximate center [85, 69]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist content view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen. This action brings the agent to the correct starting point to initiate the creation of the second playlist, \\'Adventure Marathon\\', by first navigating to the files.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab (text \\'Browse\\' at [952, 448, 966, 556], center approx. [959, 502]). This tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, where files can be located. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab (coordinates approx. [959, 502]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. The \\'Browse\\' tab is now highlighted, and the screen displays options like \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing navigation to the required files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[485,180],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Internal memory\\' (text \\'Inter\\' at [484, 179, 498, 252] and \\'ory\\' at [487, 57, 517, 135], center approx. [485, 180]). This item is currently visible. This action is expected to open the internal storage, allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Internal memory\\' (coordinates approx. [485, 180]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the main \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. The screen now lists the contents of the internal storage. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder where the required files are located.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This action is expected to reveal more folders, including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which is needed to select the files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' view. As a result, the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is now visible on the screen.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

[398, 211]). This playlist is currently visible. This action is expected to open the playlist, allowing verification of its contents. Actual Outcome: The action of tapping on the \\'Ultimate Fails Ser...\\' playlist was successful. The screen changed to display the contents of the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist. The listed files (\\'2023_03_29_highlight_14_\\', \\'scene_94_HD_MYI6\\', \\'moment_1_HD_2023_07_27\\', \\'recording_61_4K_final\\') and their order match the requirements. This allowed for the successful verification of the playlist, completing a key step of the active subgoal.\\n Step 23: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,69],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top-left of the screen (approximate center [85, 69]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to navigate from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist content view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen, where all created playlists are listed. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximate center [85, 69]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist content view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen. This action brings the agent to the correct starting point to initiate the creation of the second playlist, \\'Adventure Marathon\\', by first navigating to the files.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab (text \\'Browse\\' at [952, 448, 966, 556], center approx. [959, 502]). This tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, where files can be located. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab (coordinates approx. [959, 502]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. The \\'Browse\\' tab is now highlighted, and the screen displays options like \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing navigation to the required files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[485,180],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Internal memory\\' (text \\'Inter\\' at [484, 179, 498, 252] and \\'ory\\' at [487, 57, 517, 135], center approx. [485, 180]). This item is currently visible. This action is expected to open the internal storage, allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Internal memory\\' (coordinates approx. [485, 180]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the main \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. The screen now lists the contents of the internal storage. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder where the required files are located.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This action is expected to reveal more folders, including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which is needed to select the files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' view. As a result, the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 27: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to navigate from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist content view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen, where all created playlists are listed. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximate center [85, 69]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist content view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen. This action brings the agent to the correct starting point to initiate the creation of the second playlist, \\'Adventure Marathon\\', by first navigating to the files.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab (text \\'Browse\\' at [952, 448, 966, 556], center approx. [959, 502]). This tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, where files can be located. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab (coordinates approx. [959, 502]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. The \\'Browse\\' tab is now highlighted, and the screen displays options like \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing navigation to the required files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[485,180],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Internal memory\\' (text \\'Inter\\' at [484, 179, 498, 252] and \\'ory\\' at [487, 57, 517, 135], center approx.

Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Internal memory\\' (coordinates approx. [485, 180]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the main \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. The screen now lists the contents of the internal storage. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder where the required files are located.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This action is expected to reveal more folders, including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which is needed to select the files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' view. As a result, the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,271],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder (text \\'VLCVideos\\' at [920, 173, 940, 370], center approx.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[85,69],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the back arrow icon located at the top-left of the screen (approximate center [85, 69]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to navigate from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist content view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen, where all created playlists are listed. Actual Outcome: The tap on the back arrow icon (approximate center [85, 69]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist content view back to the main \\'Playlists\\' screen. This action brings the agent to the correct starting point to initiate the creation of the second playlist, \\'Adventure Marathon\\', by first navigating to the files.\\n Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab (text \\'Browse\\' at [952, 448, 966, 556], center approx. [959, 502]). This tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, where files can be located. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab (coordinates approx. [959, 502]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. The \\'Browse\\' tab is now highlighted, and the screen displays options like \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing navigation to the required files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[485,180],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Internal memory\\' (text \\'Inter\\' at [484, 179, 498, 252] and \\'ory\\' at [487, 57, 517, 135], center approx. [485, 180]). This item is currently visible. This action is expected to open the internal storage, allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Internal memory\\' (coordinates approx. [485, 180]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the main \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. The screen now lists the contents of the internal storage. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder where the required files are located.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This action is expected to reveal more folders, including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which is needed to select the files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' view. As a result, the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,271],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder (text \\'VLCVideos\\' at [920, 173, 940, 370], center approx. [930, 271]). This folder is currently visible. This action is expected to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, displaying its contents, which are needed for creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder (text \\'VLCVideos\\' at [920, 173, 940, 370] in the previous screen) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Internal memory\\' view to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, displaying a list of video files. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 28: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

[959, 502]). This tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, where files can be located. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab (coordinates approx. [959, 502]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. The \\'Browse\\' tab is now highlighted, and the screen displays options like \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing navigation to the required files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[485,180],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Internal memory\\' (text \\'Inter\\' at [484, 179, 498, 252] and \\'ory\\' at [487, 57, 517, 135], center approx. [485, 180]). This item is currently visible. This action is expected to open the internal storage, allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Internal memory\\' (coordinates approx. [485, 180]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the main \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. The screen now lists the contents of the internal storage. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder where the required files are located.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This action is expected to reveal more folders, including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which is needed to select the files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' view. As a result, the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,271],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder (text \\'VLCVideos\\' at [920, 173, 940, 370], center approx. [930, 271]). This folder is currently visible. This action is expected to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, displaying its contents, which are needed for creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder (text \\'VLCVideos\\' at [920, 173, 940, 370] in the previous screen) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Internal memory\\' view to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, displaying a list of video files. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[483,432],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (text \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' at [465, 171, 502, 694], center approx. [483, 432]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, which is the first step in adding it to the new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (coordinates approx. [483, 432]) resulted in the video starting to play, as indicated by the second screenshot showing a video player interface. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the goal was to select the file, not play it. To correct this, the agent needs to go back to the file list and then use a long_press action to select the file.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot. As a high confidence threshold was used, some objects are likely missing. Use the detected elements together with the screenshot and your visual grounding and referring abilities to determine essential coordinates.\\nFirst, a list of detected texts:\\n[\"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 0, 65, 75], \\'text\\': \\'P:0 / 1\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 141, 65, 220], \\'text\\': \\'IdX: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 284, 65, 362], \\'text\\': \\'IdY: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 426, 65, 503], \\'text\\': \\'Jxv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 569, 65, 646], \\'text\\': \\'JYv: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 712, 65, 796], \\'text\\': \\'JPrs: 0.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [55, 854, 66, 950], \\'text\\': \\'[Size: 1.0\\'}\", \"{\\'box_2d\\': [462, 147, 508, 704], \\'text\\': \\'Jn34f60171\\'}\"]\\nSecond, a list of detected icon bounding boxes:\\n[]\\n\\n Additional information about possible text input: \\nNo text input is possible.

If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 24: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,502],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab (text \\'Browse\\' at [952, 448, 966, 556], center approx. [959, 502]). This tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to navigate to the \\'Browse\\' section of the VLC app, where files can be located. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'Browse\\' tab (coordinates approx. [959, 502]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Playlists\\' screen to the \\'Browse\\' screen. The \\'Browse\\' tab is now highlighted, and the screen displays options like \\'Favorites\\', \\'Storages\\' (including \\'Internal memory\\'), and \\'Local Network\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing navigation to the required files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[485,180],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Internal memory\\' (text \\'Inter\\' at [484, 179, 498, 252] and \\'ory\\' at [487, 57, 517, 135], center approx. [485, 180]). This item is currently visible. This action is expected to open the internal storage, allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Internal memory\\' (coordinates approx. [485, 180]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the main \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. The screen now lists the contents of the internal storage. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder where the required files are located.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This action is expected to reveal more folders, including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which is needed to select the files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' view. As a result, the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,271],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder (text \\'VLCVideos\\' at [920, 173, 940, 370], center approx. [930, 271]). This folder is currently visible. This action is expected to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, displaying its contents, which are needed for creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder (text \\'VLCVideos\\' at [920, 173, 940, 370] in the previous screen) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Internal memory\\' view to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, displaying a list of video files. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[483,432],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (text \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' at [465, 171, 502, 694], center approx. [483, 432]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, which is the first step in adding it to the new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (coordinates approx. [483, 432]) resulted in the video starting to play, as indicated by the second screenshot showing a video player interface. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the goal was to select the file, not play it. To correct this, the agent needs to go back to the file list and then use a long_press action to select the file.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 29: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to return from the video player to the file list in the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The current screen shows a video playing. This action is expected to stop the video playback and display the list of files again.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[485,180],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Internal memory\\' (text \\'Inter\\' at [484, 179, 498, 252] and \\'ory\\' at [487, 57, 517, 135], center approx. [485, 180]). This item is currently visible. This action is expected to open the internal storage, allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Internal memory\\' (coordinates approx. [485, 180]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the main \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. The screen now lists the contents of the internal storage. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder where the required files are located.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This action is expected to reveal more folders, including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which is needed to select the files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' view. As a result, the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,271],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder (text \\'VLCVideos\\' at [920, 173, 940, 370], center approx. [930, 271]). This folder is currently visible. This action is expected to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, displaying its contents, which are needed for creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder (text \\'VLCVideos\\' at [920, 173, 940, 370] in the previous screen) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Internal memory\\' view to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, displaying a list of video files. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[483,432],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (text \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' at [465, 171, 502, 694], center approx. [483, 432]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, which is the first step in adding it to the new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (coordinates approx. [483, 432]) resulted in the video starting to play, as indicated by the second screenshot showing a video player interface. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the goal was to select the file, not play it. To correct this, the agent needs to go back to the file list and then use a long_press action to select the file.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to return from the video player to the file list in the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The current screen shows a video playing. This action is expected to stop the video playback and display the list of files again. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The VLC app navigated from the video player screen back to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, displaying the list of video files. The screen changed from showing a playing video to showing the file browser. This action brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist, as it corrected the previous erroneous action of playing the video instead of selecting it.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right.

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 25: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[485,180],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on \\'Internal memory\\' (text \\'Inter\\' at [484, 179, 498, 252] and \\'ory\\' at [487, 57, 517, 135], center approx. [485, 180]). This item is currently visible. This action is expected to open the internal storage, allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'Internal memory\\' (coordinates approx. [485, 180]) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the main \\'Browse\\' screen to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. The screen now lists the contents of the internal storage. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing navigation to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder where the required files are located.\\n Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This action is expected to reveal more folders, including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which is needed to select the files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' view. As a result, the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,271],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder (text \\'VLCVideos\\' at [920, 173, 940, 370], center approx. [930, 271]). This folder is currently visible. This action is expected to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, displaying its contents, which are needed for creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder (text \\'VLCVideos\\' at [920, 173, 940, 370] in the previous screen) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Internal memory\\' view to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, displaying a list of video files. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[483,432],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (text \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' at [465, 171, 502, 694], center approx. [483, 432]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, which is the first step in adding it to the new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (coordinates approx. [483, 432]) resulted in the video starting to play, as indicated by the second screenshot showing a video player interface. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the goal was to select the file, not play it. To correct this, the agent needs to go back to the file list and then use a long_press action to select the file.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to return from the video player to the file list in the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The current screen shows a video playing. This action is expected to stop the video playback and display the list of files again. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The VLC app navigated from the video player screen back to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, displaying the list of video files. The screen changed from showing a playing video to showing the file browser. This action brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist, as it corrected the previous erroneous action of playing the video instead of selecting it.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 30: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[483,432],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (text \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' at [465, 171, 502, 694], center approx. [483, 432]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, allowing it to be added to a new playlist.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This action is expected to reveal more folders, including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which is needed to select the files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' view. As a result, the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,271],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder (text \\'VLCVideos\\' at [920, 173, 940, 370], center approx. [930, 271]). This folder is currently visible. This action is expected to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, displaying its contents, which are needed for creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder (text \\'VLCVideos\\' at [920, 173, 940, 370] in the previous screen) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Internal memory\\' view to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, displaying a list of video files. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[483,432],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (text \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' at [465, 171, 502, 694], center approx. [483, 432]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, which is the first step in adding it to the new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (coordinates approx. [483, 432]) resulted in the video starting to play, as indicated by the second screenshot showing a video player interface. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the goal was to select the file, not play it. To correct this, the agent needs to go back to the file list and then use a long_press action to select the file.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to return from the video player to the file list in the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The current screen shows a video playing. This action is expected to stop the video playback and display the list of files again. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The VLC app navigated from the video player screen back to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, displaying the list of video files. The screen changed from showing a playing video to showing the file browser. This action brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist, as it corrected the previous erroneous action of playing the video instead of selecting it.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[483,432],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (text \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' at [465, 171, 502, 694], center approx. [483, 432]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, allowing it to be added to a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected, indicated by its highlighted background and the \\'1 selected\\' message in the header. New contextual icons (info, play, delete, sort/filter) appeared at the top of the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 26: Action: {\"name\":\"Swipe on the screen from start_point to end_point.\",\"start_point\":[800,500],\"end_point\":[200,500],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Swipe up on the screen (from [800, 500] to [200, 500]) to scroll down the list of folders in \\'Internal memory\\'. This action is expected to reveal more folders, including the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, which is needed to select the files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The swipe action successfully scrolled the list of folders in the \\'Internal memory\\' view. As a result, the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder is now visible on the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,271],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder (text \\'VLCVideos\\' at [920, 173, 940, 370], center approx. [930, 271]). This folder is currently visible. This action is expected to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, displaying its contents, which are needed for creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder (text \\'VLCVideos\\' at [920, 173, 940, 370] in the previous screen) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Internal memory\\' view to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, displaying a list of video files. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[483,432],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (text \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' at [465, 171, 502, 694], center approx. [483, 432]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, which is the first step in adding it to the new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (coordinates approx. [483, 432]) resulted in the video starting to play, as indicated by the second screenshot showing a video player interface. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the goal was to select the file, not play it. To correct this, the agent needs to go back to the file list and then use a long_press action to select the file.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to return from the video player to the file list in the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The current screen shows a video playing. This action is expected to stop the video playback and display the list of files again. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The VLC app navigated from the video player screen back to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, displaying the list of video files. The screen changed from showing a playing video to showing the file browser. This action brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist, as it corrected the previous erroneous action of playing the video instead of selecting it.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[483,432],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (text \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' at [465, 171, 502, 694], center approx. [483, 432]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, allowing it to be added to a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected, indicated by its highlighted background and the \\'1 selected\\' message in the header. New contextual icons (info, play, delete, sort/filter) appeared at the top of the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 31: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[237,405],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4\\' (text \\'8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4\\' at [219, 171, 255, 640], center approx. [237, 405]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, adding it to the current selection for the new playlist.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,271],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder (text \\'VLCVideos\\' at [920, 173, 940, 370], center approx. [930, 271]). This folder is currently visible. This action is expected to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, displaying its contents, which are needed for creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder (text \\'VLCVideos\\' at [920, 173, 940, 370] in the previous screen) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Internal memory\\' view to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, displaying a list of video files. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[483,432],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (text \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' at [465, 171, 502, 694], center approx. [483, 432]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, which is the first step in adding it to the new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (coordinates approx. [483, 432]) resulted in the video starting to play, as indicated by the second screenshot showing a video player interface. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the goal was to select the file, not play it. To correct this, the agent needs to go back to the file list and then use a long_press action to select the file.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to return from the video player to the file list in the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The current screen shows a video playing. This action is expected to stop the video playback and display the list of files again. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The VLC app navigated from the video player screen back to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, displaying the list of video files. The screen changed from showing a playing video to showing the file browser. This action brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist, as it corrected the previous erroneous action of playing the video instead of selecting it.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[483,432],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (text \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' at [465, 171, 502, 694], center approx. [483, 432]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, allowing it to be added to a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected, indicated by its highlighted background and the \\'1 selected\\' message in the header. New contextual icons (info, play, delete, sort/filter) appeared at the top of the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[237,405],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4\\' (text \\'8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4\\' at [219, 171, 255, 640], center approx. [237, 405]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, adding it to the current selection for the new playlist. The header should update to \\'2 selected\\'. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by its highlighted background and the update in the header from \\'1 selected\\' to \\'2 selected\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist by adding another required file to the selection.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below.

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 27: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[930,271],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder (text \\'VLCVideos\\' at [920, 173, 940, 370], center approx. [930, 271]). This folder is currently visible. This action is expected to open the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder, displaying its contents, which are needed for creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder (text \\'VLCVideos\\' at [920, 173, 940, 370] in the previous screen) was successful. The VLC app navigated from the \\'Internal memory\\' view to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, displaying a list of video files. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by allowing the selection of files for the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[483,432],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (text \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' at [465, 171, 502, 694], center approx. [483, 432]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, which is the first step in adding it to the new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (coordinates approx. [483, 432]) resulted in the video starting to play, as indicated by the second screenshot showing a video player interface. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the goal was to select the file, not play it. To correct this, the agent needs to go back to the file list and then use a long_press action to select the file.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to return from the video player to the file list in the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The current screen shows a video playing. This action is expected to stop the video playback and display the list of files again. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The VLC app navigated from the video player screen back to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, displaying the list of video files. The screen changed from showing a playing video to showing the file browser. This action brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist, as it corrected the previous erroneous action of playing the video instead of selecting it.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[483,432],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (text \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' at [465, 171, 502, 694], center approx. [483, 432]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, allowing it to be added to a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected, indicated by its highlighted background and the \\'1 selected\\' message in the header. New contextual icons (info, play, delete, sort/filter) appeared at the top of the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[237,405],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4\\' (text \\'8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4\\' at [219, 171, 255, 640], center approx. [237, 405]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, adding it to the current selection for the new playlist. The header should update to \\'2 selected\\'. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by its highlighted background and the update in the header from \\'1 selected\\' to \\'2 selected\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist by adding another required file to the selection.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 32: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[483,432],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (text \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' at [465, 171, 502, 694], center approx. [483, 432]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, which is the first step in adding it to the new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (coordinates approx. [483, 432]) resulted in the video starting to play, as indicated by the second screenshot showing a video player interface. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the goal was to select the file, not play it. To correct this, the agent needs to go back to the file list and then use a long_press action to select the file.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to return from the video player to the file list in the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The current screen shows a video playing. This action is expected to stop the video playback and display the list of files again. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The VLC app navigated from the video player screen back to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, displaying the list of video files. The screen changed from showing a playing video to showing the file browser. This action brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist, as it corrected the previous erroneous action of playing the video instead of selecting it.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[483,432],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (text \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' at [465, 171, 502, 694], center approx. [483, 432]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, allowing it to be added to a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected, indicated by its highlighted background and the \\'1 selected\\' message in the header. New contextual icons (info, play, delete, sort/filter) appeared at the top of the screen. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 31: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point.

[237, 405]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, adding it to the current selection for the new playlist. The header should update to \\'2 selected\\'. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by its highlighted background and the update in the header from \\'1 selected\\' to \\'2 selected\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist by adding another required file to the selection.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[791,405],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4\\' (text \\'footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4\\' at [773, 168, 810, 643], center approx. [791, 405]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, adding it to the current selection for the new playlist. The header should update to \\'3 selected\\'. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by its highlighted background and the update in the header from \\'2 selected\\' to \\'3 selected\\'.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000.

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 28: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[483,432],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the file \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (text \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' at [465, 171, 502, 694], center approx. [483, 432]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, which is the first step in adding it to the new playlist. Actual Outcome: The tap on \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (coordinates approx. [483, 432]) resulted in the video starting to play, as indicated by the second screenshot showing a video player interface. This action did not bring the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the goal was to select the file, not play it. To correct this, the agent needs to go back to the file list and then use a long_press action to select the file.\\n Step 29: Action: {\"name\":\"Use \\'adb shell input keyevent keycode\\' to raise a keyevent.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"KEYCODE_BACK\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Press the back button to return from the video player to the file list in the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder. The current screen shows a video playing. This action is expected to stop the video playback and display the list of files again. Actual Outcome: The `KEYCODE_BACK` action was successful. The VLC app navigated from the video player screen back to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view, displaying the list of video files. The screen changed from showing a playing video to showing the file browser. This action brought the agent back on track to complete the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist, as it corrected the previous erroneous action of playing the video instead of selecting it.\\n Step 30: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[483,432],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' (text \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' at [465, 171, 502, 694], center approx. [483, 432]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, allowing it to be added to a new playlist. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected, indicated by its highlighted background and the \\'1 selected\\' message in the header.

[237, 405]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, adding it to the current selection for the new playlist. The header should update to \\'2 selected\\'. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by its highlighted background and the update in the header from \\'1 selected\\' to \\'2 selected\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist by adding another required file to the selection.\\n Step 32: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[791,405],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4\\' (text \\'footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4\\' at [773, 168, 810, 643], center approx. [791, 405]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, adding it to the current selection for the new playlist. The header should update to \\'3 selected\\'. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by its highlighted background and the update in the header from \\'2 selected\\' to \\'3 selected\\'.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\n### User Instruction ###\\nCreate a playlist titled \"Ultimate Fails Series\" with the following files in VLC (located in Internal Memory/VLCVideos), in order: 2023_03_29_highlight_14_.mp4, scene_94_HD_MYI6.mp4, moment_1_HD_2023_07_27.mp4, recording_61_4K_final.mp4.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text you can edit is: \"Playlist name\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[606,404],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4\\' (text \\'D7BO_highlight_2_4K.mp4\\' at [588, 173, 625, 635], center approx. [606, 404]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, adding it to the current selection for the new playlist. The header should update to \\'4 selected\\'. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4\\' (coordinates approx. [606, 404]) was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by its highlighted background and the update in the header from \\'3 selected\\' to \\'4 selected\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist by selecting the final required file.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,937],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the menu icon (filter/sort icon) at the top right of the screen (approx. [88, 937]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options like \\'Add to new playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the menu icon (three dots) at [88, 937] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen. This menu provides options to \\'Add to new playlist\\' or \\'Add to existing playlist\\'. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' section includes a text field for \\'Playlist name\\' and a \\'SAVE\\' button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening the necessary menu to create the new playlist.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[787,411],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (bounding box `[755, 12, 819, 811]`, center approx. `[787, 411]`). This text field is currently empty with placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. This action is expected to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the new playlist name. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (approx. [787, 411]) was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\". This allows for text input into the \\'Playlist name\\' field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Adventure Marathon\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Adventure Marathon\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Adventure Marathon\\'. The virtual keyboard is visible, confirming text input is possible. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Adventure Marathon\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Adventure Marathon\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. The virtual keyboard remains active. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the playlist now has its intended name. The next step is to tap the \\'SAVE\\' button.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

The text you can edit is: \"Adventure Marathon\" If this is not the text field you want to edit, select another text field. Before doing text operations, you should use this data and the screenshot to determine if you have the right text field selected. Before confirming a search you should make sure that the search text is correct.The virtual keyboard is visible, which means that you can input text into a text field. Empty text fields usually have some kind of placeholder text in them. Tap on placeholder text to get started. For already filled text fields, tap on the detected text. Placeholder text does not need to be deleted; it usually disappears automatically after input.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is open. You can input or delete text.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

[791, 405]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, adding it to the current selection for the new playlist. The header should update to \\'3 selected\\'. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4\\' was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by its highlighted background and the update in the header from \\'2 selected\\' to \\'3 selected\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist by adding another required file to the selection.\\n Step 33: Action: {\"name\":\"Long press on the screen at start_point. For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[606,404],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4\\' (text \\'D7BO_highlight_2_4K.mp4\\' at [588, 173, 625, 635], center approx. [606, 404]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, adding it to the current selection for the new playlist. The header should update to \\'4 selected\\'. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4\\' (coordinates approx. [606, 404]) was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by its highlighted background and the update in the header from \\'3 selected\\' to \\'4 selected\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist by selecting the final required file.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,937],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the menu icon (filter/sort icon) at the top right of the screen (approx. [88, 937]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options like \\'Add to new playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the menu icon (three dots) at [88, 937] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen. This menu provides options to \\'Add to new playlist\\' or \\'Add to existing playlist\\'. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' section includes a text field for \\'Playlist name\\' and a \\'SAVE\\' button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening the necessary menu to create the new playlist.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[787,411],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (bounding box `[755, 12, 819, 811]`, center approx. `[787, 411]`). This text field is currently empty with placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. This action is expected to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the new playlist name. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (approx. [787, 411]) was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\". This allows for text input into the \\'Playlist name\\' field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Adventure Marathon\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Adventure Marathon\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Adventure Marathon\\'. The virtual keyboard is visible, confirming text input is possible. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Adventure Marathon\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Adventure Marathon\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. The virtual keyboard remains active. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the playlist now has its intended name. The next step is to tap the \\'SAVE\\' button.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 37: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[606,404],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4\\' (text \\'D7BO_highlight_2_4K.mp4\\' at [588, 173, 625, 635], center approx. [606, 404]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, adding it to the current selection for the new playlist. The header should update to \\'4 selected\\'. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4\\' (coordinates approx. [606, 404]) was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by its highlighted background and the update in the header from \\'3 selected\\' to \\'4 selected\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist by selecting the final required file.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,937],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the menu icon (filter/sort icon) at the top right of the screen (approx. [88, 937]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options like \\'Add to new playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the menu icon (three dots) at [88, 937] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen. This menu provides options to \\'Add to new playlist\\' or \\'Add to existing playlist\\'. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' section includes a text field for \\'Playlist name\\' and a \\'SAVE\\' button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening the necessary menu to create the new playlist.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[787,411],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (bounding box `[755, 12, 819, 811]`, center approx. `[787, 411]`). This text field is currently empty with placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. This action is expected to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the new playlist name. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (approx. [787, 411]) was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\". This allows for text input into the \\'Playlist name\\' field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Adventure Marathon\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Adventure Marathon\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Adventure Marathon\\'. The virtual keyboard is visible, confirming text input is possible. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Adventure Marathon\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Adventure Marathon\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. The virtual keyboard remains active. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the playlist now has its intended name. The next step is to tap the \\'SAVE\\' button.\\n Step 37: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[786,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button (text \\'SAVE\\' at [778, 853, 794, 954], center approx. [786, 903]). This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to save the new playlist named \\'Adventure Marathon\\' with the selected files. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Adventure Marathon\\' should now be created with the four selected files. The screen returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible.

For some user interface elements, this is used for secondary interactions like selecting and elements for deletion.\",\"start_point\":[606,404],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Long-press on the file \\'D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4\\' (text \\'D7BO_highlight_2_4K.mp4\\' at [588, 173, 625, 635], center approx. [606, 404]). This file is currently visible and not selected. This action is expected to select the file, adding it to the current selection for the new playlist. The header should update to \\'4 selected\\'. Actual Outcome: The long_press action on \\'D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4\\' (coordinates approx. [606, 404]) was successful. The file is now selected, as indicated by its highlighted background and the update in the header from \\'3 selected\\' to \\'4 selected\\'. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist by selecting the final required file.\\n Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,937],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the menu icon (filter/sort icon) at the top right of the screen (approx. [88, 937]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options like \\'Add to new playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the menu icon (three dots) at [88, 937] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen. This menu provides options to \\'Add to new playlist\\' or \\'Add to existing playlist\\'. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' section includes a text field for \\'Playlist name\\' and a \\'SAVE\\' button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening the necessary menu to create the new playlist.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[787,411],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (bounding box `[755, 12, 819, 811]`, center approx. `[787, 411]`). This text field is currently empty with placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. This action is expected to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the new playlist name. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (approx. [787, 411]) was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\". This allows for text input into the \\'Playlist name\\' field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Adventure Marathon\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Adventure Marathon\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Adventure Marathon\\'. The virtual keyboard is visible, confirming text input is possible. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Adventure Marathon\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Adventure Marathon\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. The virtual keyboard remains active. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the playlist now has its intended name. The next step is to tap the \\'SAVE\\' button.\\n Step 37: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[786,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button (text \\'SAVE\\' at [778, 853, 794, 954], center approx. [786, 903]). This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to save the new playlist named \\'Adventure Marathon\\' with the selected files. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Adventure Marathon\\' should now be created with the four selected files. The screen returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 38: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,69],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (back button) located at the top left of the screen, to the left of \\'VLCVideos\\'. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to navigate back from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,937],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the menu icon (filter/sort icon) at the top right of the screen (approx. [88, 937]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options like \\'Add to new playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the menu icon (three dots) at [88, 937] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen. This menu provides options to \\'Add to new playlist\\' or \\'Add to existing playlist\\'. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' section includes a text field for \\'Playlist name\\' and a \\'SAVE\\' button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening the necessary menu to create the new playlist.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[787,411],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (bounding box `[755, 12, 819, 811]`, center approx. `[787, 411]`). This text field is currently empty with placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. This action is expected to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the new playlist name. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (approx. [787, 411]) was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\". This allows for text input into the \\'Playlist name\\' field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Adventure Marathon\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Adventure Marathon\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Adventure Marathon\\'. The virtual keyboard is visible, confirming text input is possible. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Adventure Marathon\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Adventure Marathon\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. The virtual keyboard remains active. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the playlist now has its intended name. The next step is to tap the \\'SAVE\\' button.\\n Step 37: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[786,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button (text \\'SAVE\\' at [778, 853, 794, 954], center approx. [786, 903]). This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to save the new playlist named \\'Adventure Marathon\\' with the selected files. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Adventure Marathon\\' should now be created with the four selected files. The screen returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 38: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,69],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (back button) located at the top left of the screen, to the left of \\'VLCVideos\\'. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to navigate back from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the back button at [84, 69] was successful. It navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view directly to the main \\'Browse\\' screen of VLC. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to navigate to the \\'Playlists\\' tab from this screen.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

And then, create a playlist titled \"Adventure Marathon\" with the following files in VLC, in order: clip_12_HD_2023_02_25.mp4, 8u3n_footage_29_HD.mp4, footage_46_raw_jZFR.mp4, D7B0_highlight_2_4K.mp4.\\n\\n### Recent Action History ###\\nThere is history for the 5 steps:  Step 34: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[88,937],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the menu icon (filter/sort icon) at the top right of the screen (approx. [88, 937]). This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to open a menu with options like \\'Add to new playlist\\'. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the menu icon (three dots) at [88, 937] was successful. A pop-up menu appeared at the bottom of the screen. This menu provides options to \\'Add to new playlist\\' or \\'Add to existing playlist\\'. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' section includes a text field for \\'Playlist name\\' and a \\'SAVE\\' button. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by opening the necessary menu to create the new playlist.\\n Step 35: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[787,411],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (bounding box `[755, 12, 819, 811]`, center approx. `[787, 411]`). This text field is currently empty with placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. This action is expected to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the new playlist name. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (approx. [787, 411]) was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\". This allows for text input into the \\'Playlist name\\' field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Adventure Marathon\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Adventure Marathon\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Adventure Marathon\\'. The virtual keyboard is visible, confirming text input is possible. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Adventure Marathon\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Adventure Marathon\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. The virtual keyboard remains active. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the playlist now has its intended name. The next step is to tap the \\'SAVE\\' button.\\n Step 37: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[786,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button (text \\'SAVE\\' at [778, 853, 794, 954], center approx. [786, 903]). This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to save the new playlist named \\'Adventure Marathon\\' with the selected files. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Adventure Marathon\\' should now be created with the four selected files. The screen returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 38: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,69],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (back button) located at the top left of the screen, to the left of \\'VLCVideos\\'. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to navigate back from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the back button at [84, 69] was successful. It navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view directly to the main \\'Browse\\' screen of VLC. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to navigate to the \\'Playlists\\' tab from this screen.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 39: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab (text \\'Playlists\\' at `[952, 638, 967, 763]`, center approx. `[959, 700]`). This tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to switch to the \\'Playlists\\' view, where the newly created \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist should be visible.

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[787,411],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (bounding box `[755, 12, 819, 811]`, center approx. `[787, 411]`). This text field is currently empty with placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. This action is expected to focus the text field and bring up the virtual keyboard, allowing text input for the new playlist name. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlist name\\' text field (approx. [787, 411]) was successful. The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\". This allows for text input into the \\'Playlist name\\' field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Adventure Marathon\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Adventure Marathon\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Adventure Marathon\\'. The virtual keyboard is visible, confirming text input is possible. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Adventure Marathon\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Adventure Marathon\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. The virtual keyboard remains active. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the playlist now has its intended name. The next step is to tap the \\'SAVE\\' button.\\n Step 37: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[786,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button (text \\'SAVE\\' at [778, 853, 794, 954], center approx. [786, 903]). This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to save the new playlist named \\'Adventure Marathon\\' with the selected files. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Adventure Marathon\\' should now be created with the four selected files. The screen returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 38: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,69],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (back button) located at the top left of the screen, to the left of \\'VLCVideos\\'. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to navigate back from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the back button at [84, 69] was successful. It navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view directly to the main \\'Browse\\' screen of VLC. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to navigate to the \\'Playlists\\' tab from this screen.\\n Step 39: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab (text \\'Playlists\\' at `[952, 638, 967, 763]`, center approx. `[959, 700]`). This tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to switch to the \\'Playlists\\' view, where the newly created \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist should be visible. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlists\\' tab (text \\'Playlists\\' at `[952, 638, 967, 763]`, center approx. `[959, 700]`) was successful. The VLC app switched from the \\'Browse\\' tab to the \\'Playlists\\' tab. The \\'Playlists\\' view now shows the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist and the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by navigating to the correct screen to verify the newly created playlist.\\n\\n### Screen Information Text ###\\nText and icon detection was used to determine the bounding boxes of icons and text in the screenshot.

To input text, tap on a text field to open the virtual keyboard first.\\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\\nYou are given a screenshot of the device screen. This is your most important source of information.\\n\\n### Tips ###\\nThe following tips might be useful:\\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\n---\\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, attempt to rectify it.### Tips for Swiping ###\\nSwipe from position [start_y, start_x] to position [end_y, end_x]. To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. If possible, start swipes at the center of objects you want to interact with in order to simulate human behavior more realistically.The virtual keyboard is currently not visible. To input or delete text, first select the correct text field.\\nHINT: If multiple tap actions fail to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",

The text field is now focused, and the virtual keyboard has appeared at the bottom of the screen, as indicated by \"ADB Keyboard (ON)\". This allows for text input into the \\'Playlist name\\' field. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal of creating the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist.\\n Step 36: Action: {\"name\":\"Append the provided text to the end of the text in the currently focused text field.\",\"start_point\":[0,0],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"Adventure Marathon\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Input the text \\'Adventure Marathon\\' into the focused \\'Playlist name\\' text field. The text field currently contains the placeholder text \\'Playlist name\\'. This action will replace the placeholder text with \\'Adventure Marathon\\'. The virtual keyboard is visible, confirming text input is possible. Actual Outcome: The action of inputting \\'Adventure Marathon\\' into the \\'Playlist name\\' text field was successful. The text field now displays \\'Adventure Marathon\\', as confirmed by the second screenshot and the screen information text. The virtual keyboard remains active. This action has brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the playlist now has its intended name. The next step is to tap the \\'SAVE\\' button.\\n Step 37: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[786,903],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'SAVE\\' button (text \\'SAVE\\' at [778, 853, 794, 954], center approx. [786, 903]). This button is currently visible and enabled. This action is expected to save the new playlist named \\'Adventure Marathon\\' with the selected files. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'SAVE\\' button was successful. The \\'Add to new playlist\\' dialog closed, and the playlist \\'Adventure Marathon\\' should now be created with the four selected files. The screen returned to the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view. This action brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal.\\n Step 38: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[84,69],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'X\\' icon (back button) located at the top left of the screen, to the left of \\'VLCVideos\\'. This icon is currently visible. This action is expected to navigate back from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder to the \\'Internal memory\\' folder view. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the back button at [84, 69] was successful. It navigated from the \\'VLCVideos\\' folder view directly to the main \\'Browse\\' screen of VLC. This brings the agent closer to completing the active subgoal, as the next step is to navigate to the \\'Playlists\\' tab from this screen.\\n Step 39: Action: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[959,700],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Playlists\\' tab (text \\'Playlists\\' at `[952, 638, 967, 763]`, center approx. `[959, 700]`). This tab is currently not selected. This action is expected to switch to the \\'Playlists\\' view, where the newly created \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist should be visible. Actual Outcome: The tap action on the \\'Playlists\\' tab (text \\'Playlists\\' at `[952, 638, 967, 763]`, center approx. `[959, 700]`) was successful. The VLC app switched from the \\'Browse\\' tab to the \\'Playlists\\' tab. The \\'Playlists\\' view now shows the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist and the \\'Ultimate Fails Series\\' playlist. This action brought the agent closer to completing the active subgoal by navigating to the correct screen to verify the newly created playlist.\\n\\nThe history does not yet contain information for the latest Action:  Step 40: {\"name\":\"Tap on the screen at start_point. This is often used for primary interaction with most user interface elements.\",\"start_point\":[398,205],\"end_point\":[0,0],\"text\":\"\",\"keycode\":\"\"}, Action Description and Predicted Outcome: Tap on the \\'Adventure Marathon\\' playlist (text \\'Adventure Marat...\\' at `[379, 46, 417, 364]`, center approx. `[398, 205]`).

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app. Pop-ups can usually be closed by either tapping a special button on the pop-up or, if such a thing does not exist, by tapping somewhere else on the screen.\\n1. Make sure that the search field really contains the correct search text before starting a search. Text below the search field might only be a suggestion.\\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\\n4. Often, after entering an email address or other information into some text field, you need to hit enter to confirm the input. It is possible that without confirmation, a list of suggestions might appear for some text fields.\\n5. UI elements like a switched toggle or other colorful indicators hint at the state of the program.\\n6. In order to enable or disable some options, prioritize clicking on buttons or sliders. Only if there is no such thing as an option, try tapping on text.\\n7. Do not just start inputting text. You first have to be sure you selected the right text field. Placeholder text can be great for finding the correct text field.\\n8. If you want to change some settings for the Android device, you usually have to open the \\'Settings\\' app.\\n9. If you do not see an app on the home screen, check the app drawer to see if you can find it there.\\n10. Opening the app drawer by swiping up requires that the swipe does not start too close to the bottom of the screen. Starting the upward swipe at y = 900 works to open the app drawer if the swipe is long enough.\\n11. When applicable, interact with the center of UI elements, e.g., start swipes, tap, and long_presses on the center of the UI element you want to interact with.\\n12. Do not input or delete text character by character if possible. Prefer the \\'text\\' and \\'delete\\' actions for efficient text operations.\\n13. To interact more often with the intended target for \\'tap\\', \\'long_press\\', or \\'swipe\\', try to interact with the center of the biggest icon or text, which interaction leads closer to the fulfillment of the subgoal. For text fields, prefer the center of the existing text. To tap or long_press a button, interact with the center of the button. For swiping sliders, select points on the central axis in the direction of movement.\\n14. If other user interface elements mostly cover an element you want to interact with, try to use a swipe to uncover it first.\\n15. You are really bad at recognizing sliders. If you see a search bar, when you need a slider try swiping on it to check if it is actually a slider. Important: Do not just swipe on the screen without an element that could be a slider. Seriously, do not just assume that a slider is somewhere without a good reason like a long object that you think could be searchbar.\\n16. If you want to set a slider all the way to the right or the left, swipe more than needed to ensure the correct result.\\n17. Pressing \\'Back\\' while the virtual keyboard is open will close the keyboard. If you want to navigate to the previous page, prefer tapping on user interface elements to save a step.\\n18. Some tasks ask you to work with apps like \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\', \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\', or other \\'Simple Something Pro\\' apps. The name of these Simple Pro apps is displayed differently: e.g., for \\'Simple Gallery Pro\\' the app name is \\'Gallery\\', for \\'Simple Calendar Pro\\' it is \\'Calendar\\' and so on.\\n19. Instead of \\'Simple SMS Messenger\\' use the \\'SMS Messenger\\' app. It has an orange icon. Do not use the \\'Messages\\' app.\\n\\n\\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the last action was successful and update the active Subgoal accordingly.To fulfill the user instruction, you can only plan using the following actions: tap, long_press, swipe, input text into the currently selected text field, delete text from the currently selected text field, wait for 10 seconds, and you can also raise keyevents via \\'adb shell input keyevent\\', e.g., press the back, home, enter buttons or similar. Finally, you can send an answer to the user. Only use answer as the last action, as it terminates the execution. Additionally, to enable information retrieval, you can add information and information requests to the agent\\'s memory.---\\nOrientation information: The top left corner of the screen is the origin. The x and y axis go horizontally and vertically, respectively. Coordinate values are normalized to 0-1000. Point are given in [y, x] format, Bounding box in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format. \\nTips for Swiping: For example, swiping from position [500, 500] to position [250, 500] will swipe upwards to review additional content below. Swiping from [250, 500] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping down. Swiping from [500, 250] to position [500, 500] would be Swiping to the right. Swiping from [500, 500] to position [500, 250] would be Swiping to the left. Provide your output in the specified format.'])]",
